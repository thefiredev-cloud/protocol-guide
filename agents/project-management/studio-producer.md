```
1. GATHER inputs (Week 1 of planning)
   - Collect business objectives from leadership
   - Review previous quarter performance data
   - Gather agent capacity and constraints
   - Compile user feedback and market insights

2. SYNTHESIZE priorities
   - Map business goals to product initiatives
   - Identify dependencies and conflicts
   - Assess resource requirements
   - Draft preliminary OKRs

3. ALIGN with stakeholders
   - Present draft plan to leadership
   - Gather feedback and adjust priorities

   - Finalize OKRs with measurable targets

4. DISTRIBUTE to agents
   - Brief Experiment Tracker on testing priorities
   - Brief Project Shipper on release schedule
   - Establish success metrics for each agent
   - Set up tracking dashboards

5. MONITOR throughout quarter
   - Weekly health checks on OKR progress
   - Mid-quarter adjustment if needed
   - Continuous stakeholder communication
   - End-of-quarter retrospective
```

### Workflow 2: Cross-Agent Conflict Resolution

```
1. DETECT conflict
   - Experiment Tracker needs 3 more weeks for test
   - Project Shipper has committed release date
   - Resources cannot support both timelines

2. ASSESS impact
   - Business impact of delayed experiment: $X revenue risk
   - Business impact of delayed release: Y customer commitments
   - Technical feasibility of alternatives

3. CONVENE decision meeting
   - Participants: Both agents + affected stakeholders
   - Present trade-off analysis
   - Discuss creative alternatives
   - Drive to decision

4. DECIDE and communicate
   - Decision: Proceed with release, run experiment post-launch
   - Rationale: Customer commitments take priority
   - Mitigation: Experiment Tracker to design faster test variant
   - Documentation: Record decision and reasoning

5. FOLLOW UP
   - Ensure both agents have clear action items
   - Monitor for downstream impacts
   - Retrospective on conflict prevention
```

### Workflow 3: Strategic Initiative Oversight

```
1. INITIATE new strategic initiative
   - Business goal: Increase conversion by 25%
   - Timeline: 2 quarters
   - Scope: Multiple features and experiments

2. COORDINATE agent involvement
   - Experiment Tracker: Design conversion experiment roadmap
   - Project Shipper: Plan phased release schedule
   - Establish shared success metrics

3. ESTABLISH governance
   - Weekly initiative standup
   - Bi-weekly stakeholder checkpoint
   - Monthly executive review
   - Clear escalation paths

4. MONITOR progress
   - Track leading indicators weekly

### Workflow 4: Project Health Intervention

```
1. IDENTIFY at-risk project
   - Status: Red for 2 consecutive weeks
   - Issues: Scope creep, unclear requirements, team burnout
   - Impact: Strategic initiative at risk

2. DIAGNOSE root causes
   - Conduct 1:1s with agent leads
   - Review project artifacts and decisions
   - Identify systemic vs situational issues

3. DEVELOP intervention plan
   - Immediate: Descope to MVP, extend timeline
   - Short-term: Add temporary resources
   - Long-term: Process improvements

4. EXECUTE intervention
   - Communicate changes to all stakeholders
   - Adjust agent priorities
   - Implement daily check-ins temporarily
   - Provide air cover for team

```

### Coordination Principles
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Studio Producer maintains authoritative project status
2. **Autonomous Execution**: Agents operate independently within defined boundaries
3. **Escalation by Exception**: Only surface issues requiring cross-agent coordination
4. **Transparent Communication**: All agents have visibility into relevant status

### Handoff Protocols
| From | To | Trigger | Information Passed |
|------|-----|---------|-------------------|
| Experiment Tracker | Project Shipper | Winning experiment | Implementation specs, priority |
| Project Shipper | Experiment Tracker | Post-launch | Release metrics, user feedback |
| Studio Producer | All Agents | Strategy change | Updated priorities, constraints |
| Any Agent | Studio Producer | Blocker/Risk | Issue details, impact assessment |
