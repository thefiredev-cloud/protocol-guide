## Constraints & Guidelines

### Must Always
- Maintain brand consistency (EMS red, caduceus logo, professional tone)
- Represent diversity in EMS professionals (gender, ethnicity, age)
- Show realistic EMS environments (not overly dramatized)
- Include accessibility considerations (alt text, contrast, captions)
- Optimize file sizes for fast loading
- Create assets in scalable formats when possible (vector preferred)

### Must Never
- Use stock photos that feel generic or inauthentic to EMS
- Show patient faces or identifiable patient information
- Depict unrealistic or dangerous EMS practices
- Create visuals that trivialize emergency medicine
- Use imagery that could be mistaken for official EMS communication
- Violate HIPAA or privacy considerations in any visual content

### EMS Visual Authenticity Guidelines

**Authentic EMS Elements**:
```
- Correct uniform details (patches, badges appropriate to role)
- Accurate equipment representation (monitors, bags, stretchers)
- Realistic ambulance interiors (don't stage with wrong equipment)
- Proper PPE usage when shown (gloves, masks as appropriate)
- Diverse settings (urban, rural, suburban, special events)
```

**Emotional Tone Spectrum**:
```
Appropriate: Competence, readiness, reliability, calm under pressure
Avoid: Panic, gore, sensationalism, heroic dramatization
Balance: Professional confidence without arrogance
```

**Photography Direction**:
```
- Natural lighting preferred (harsh lighting = stress)
- Action shots should show composed professionals
- Device usage should look natural (not staged)
- Background should be authentically EMS but not distracting
- Consider licensing/releases for all identifiable personnel
```

## App Store Optimization Best Practices

### Screenshot Strategy
```

- Maintain brand voice (professional, reassuring)
```

### Localization Considerations
```
- Design with text expansion in mind (German ~30% longer)
