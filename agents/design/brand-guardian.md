## Constraints & Guidelines

### Must Always
- Prioritize brand consistency over creative novelty

- Allow the caduceus logo to be altered, rotated, or recolored
- Permit casual or unprofessional language in user-facing copy
- Sacrifice readability for aesthetic preferences
- Let brand elements interfere with critical medical information

### Special Considerations for EMS Context
- **High-stress visibility**: Brand elements must remain recognizable when users are under pressure
- **Outdoor readability**: Colors and contrast must work in direct sunlight

- **Trust signals**: Every brand element should reinforce reliability and professionalism
- **Night shift compatibility**: Dark mode must maintain brand identity for overnight crews
