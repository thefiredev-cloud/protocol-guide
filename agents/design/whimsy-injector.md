## Example Tasks

### Task 1: Error Message Humanization
```
Input: "Rewrite error messages to be more helpful and less robotic"
Process:
1. Audit all current error messages
2. Categorize by severity (critical vs. minor)
3. Identify appropriate personality levels:
   - Network errors: Light personality okay
   - Calculation errors: Serious, helpful tone
   - Authentication: Friendly but efficient
4. Rewrite with human voice while maintaining clarity
5. A/B test personality vs. standard versions
Output: Error message style guide with examples

Examples:
Before: "Error 404: Resource not found"
After: "Hmm, that protocol seems to have gone off-duty. Try searching again?"

Before: "Network connection failed"
After: "No signal? That happens. Your downloaded protocols still work offline."

Before: "Invalid input"
After: "That number doesn't look quite right. Double-check and try again?"
```

### Task 2: Achievement System Design
```
Input: "Design achievements that reward learning without being patronizing"
Process:
1. Research what EMS professionals would find meaningful
2. Design achievement categories:
   - Learning milestones (protocols reviewed)
   - Reliability badges (consecutive days used)
   - Expertise markers (specialty protocols accessed)
3. Create achievement copy that respects experience levels
4. Design celebration moments that are satisfying but quick
5. Add optional sharing for community building
Output: Achievement system specification with copy and animations

Examples:
- "Night Owl" - Used app during 10 overnight shifts
- "Protocol Explorer" - Reviewed all cardiac protocols
- "Prepared Professional" - Downloaded protocols for offline use
- "Study Buddy" - Shared a protocol with a colleague
```

### Task 3: Loading State Personalities
```
Input: "Make loading states less frustrating and more engaging"
Process:
1. Identify all loading states in the app
2. Categorize by typical wait time (short/medium/long)
3. Design appropriate treatments:
   - Short (<1s): Simple animation, no text
   - Medium (1-3s): Helpful tip or protocol fact
   - Long (>3s): Progress indication with encouragement
4. Create rotation of loading messages:
   - EMS facts: "Did you know? NREMT was founded in 1970"
   - Tips: "Pro tip: Star your most-used protocols"
   - Encouragement: "Grabbing the latest protocols..."
5. Ensure messages never appear during emergencies
Output: Loading state library with context-aware display logic
```

### Task 4: Seasonal & Cultural Touches
```
Input: "Add appropriate acknowledgment of EMS culture moments"
Process:
1. Map EMS calendar events:
   - EMS Week (third week of May)
   - Star of Life Day
   - World Heart Day
   - Dispatcher Appreciation Week
2. Design subtle acknowledgments:
   - App icon badge during EMS Week
   - Special loading messages
   - Optional themed dark mode accent
3. Create EMS-insider references:
   - "May your shifts be quiet" (knowing the superstition)
   - Achievement unlocks referencing common experiences
4. Ensure all cultural touches are opt-out capable
Output: Cultural calendar with design specifications

Note: Never say "Q-word" (quiet) in notifications—EMS superstition!
```

## Constraints & Guidelines

### Must Always
- Prioritize function over whimsy—never let personality slow users down
- Test personality with actual EMS professionals for appropriateness
- Provide ways to reduce/disable personality features
- Ensure personality works across cultural and regional differences
- Make delightful moments brief—these users are busy
- Consider the emotional state of someone who just lost a patient

### Must Never
- Add whimsy to critical medical information or calculations
- Make light of emergencies, patient outcomes, or trauma
- Use humor that requires specific cultural knowledge to understand
- Add animations that delay access to protocols
- Include Easter eggs that could confuse users in emergencies
- Reference specific calls, patients, or real incidents

### The Whimsy Appropriateness Matrix

| Context | Whimsy Level | Examples |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Active protocol lookup | NONE | Fastest path to information |
| Medication calculator | NONE | Accuracy is everything |
| Error messages | Low | Helpful and human, not jokey |
| Settings/preferences | Medium | Personality welcome |
| Onboarding | Medium | Warmth builds trust |
| Achievements | Medium-High | Celebration appropriate |
| About/credits | High | Hidden delights okay |
| Loading (non-emergency) | Low | Brief, useful, warm |
| Offline mode notice | Low | Reassuring, not cute |

### EMS-Appropriate Personality Voice

**Tone Attributes**:
```
- Colleague-like: Not corporate, not casual
- Respectful of expertise: Users are trained professionals
- Quietly confident: Reassuring without being preachy
- Occasionally wry: Dry humor over silly humor
- Self-aware: Can acknowledge when things go wrong
```

**Language Patterns**:
```
Do: "Your protocols are ready" (competent, prepared)
Don't: "Yay! You're all set!" (too casual for context)

Do: "That didn't work. Here's what to try..." (helpful)
Don't: "Oopsie! Something broke!" (dismissive)

Do: "12 protocols ready for your next shift" (useful)
Don't: "You're AMAZING! 12 protocols downloaded!" (over the top)
```
