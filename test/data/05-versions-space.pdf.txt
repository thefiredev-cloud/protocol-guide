PREHOSPITAL TREATMENT –    100.1 
 
Principle 
• The objective of prehospital treatment is to provide timely,  equitable, high-quality, and patient-centered care. 
 
Standards 
• All treatments shall be administered per protocol unless the patient declines, there is a contraindication, such as an 
allergy, or a Base Hospital Physician Order to withhold a required treatment. 
• When clinically indicated, more than one protocol may be applied for patient treatment.  
• All protocol treatments may be performed by the Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), Advanced Emergency 
Medical Technician (AEMT), and/or Paramedic via standing orders except for those stating Base Hospital Order 
(BHO) or Base Hospital Physician Order (BHPO). Standing orders may be continued after Base Hospital contact 
unless the Base Hospital directs otherwise. 
• Mobile Intensive Care Nurses (MICNs) may relay BHPOs. 
• These protocol standards do not apply when a physician on scene assumes responsibility for patient care (see S-
403 Physician on Scene). 
• Base Hospital Physician
1
 consultation is encouraged for unclear or complex situations. 
 
Base Hospital Physicians are authorized to: 
• Order additional doses or boluses of a protocolized treatment 
• Order the withholding of a protocolized treatment 
 
Base Hospital Physicians are not authorized to: 
• Order medications, routes, or procedures that are outside EMT, AEMT, or Paramedic scopes of practice
2
 
• Modify Local Optional Scope of Practice (LOSOP) protocols 
• Order treatments specifically prohibited by local CoSD EMS protocols 
 
Under extraordinary circumstances, Base Hospital Physicians may order an Emergency Protocol 
Exception (EPE) when the following conditions are met: 
• Immediate/imminent risk of serious morbidity or mortality 
• S-104 or P-115 do not explicitly prohibit use
3
 
• Complies with the above criteria for non-authorized orders 
 
The Base Hospital shall report every EPE to CoSD EMS as an “unusual event” within 24 hours
 
 
 
 
 
1
 Refer to S-403 Physician on Scene when a physician on scene assumes patient care 
2
 EMS clinicians are only permitted to follow orders within their respective local scopes of practice (B-450, B-451, P-401) 
3
 Per P-115, EPEs are not authorized for administration of ketamine in dissociative doses or naloxone in cardiac arrest

• Seizure not returned to baseline or multiple seizures 
• Syncope 
• Acute agitation 
• Severe intoxication or overdose 
 
Miscellaneous 
• Meets T-460A criteria (including special 
considerations designated for transport to a trauma 
center) 
• ALS medication administered (except single 
therapeutic treatment of naloxone, ondansetron, 
glucagon, dextrose, or acetaminophen and are not 
anticipated to require repeat doses) 
• Hypoglycemia with persistent altered mental status 
• Hyperglycemia with persistent altered mental status 
• Pediatric patients with a high-risk complaint (e.g., 
BRUE) or complex medical history

Spinal Motion 
Restriction  
 
(continued) 
 
Spinal Motion Restriction: 
-The use of an appropriately sized cervical collar on a stretcher while 
limiting the movement of the spine and maintaining “neutral” in-line 
position. 
 
-Backboards should be limited to extrication whenever possible. In-line 
stabilization should be maintained with the patient supine and neutral on 
the gurney during transport. 
 
-If a patient is not able to tolerate the supine position during transport, 
document the reason and communicate to receiving hospital staff. 
 
Sports Injury Patient  
If a patient is helmeted and/or shoulder padded, patient helmet and pads 
should be removed while on scene.  
 
Document a neurological examination including: 
• Test of sensation and abnormal sensation (paresthesia) in all 4 
extremities 
• Test of motor skills in all 4 extremities with active movements by 
the patient (avoid just reflexive movements like hand grasp to 
include: 
-      Wrist/finger extension and flexion 
-      Foot plantar and dorsiflexion 
 
Pediatric Patient 
N-no altered LOC 
E-evidence of obvious injury absent 
C-complete spontaneous ROM without pain

Pediatrics Patients and Car Seats 
Infants restrained in a rear-facing car seat may be immobilized and 
extricated in the car seat. The child may remain in the car seat if the 
immobilization is secure and his/her condition allows (no signs of 
respiratory distress or shock). 
 
Children restrained in a car seat (with a high back) may be immobilized 
and extricated in the car seat; however, once removed from the vehicle, the 
child should be placed in spinal immobilization. 
 
Children restrained in a booster seat (without a back) need to be 
extricated and immobilized following standard spinal immobilization 
procedures.

S-Spine exam- Does the patient complain of neck or back pain? Assess entire spine for  
point tenderness or spinal process tenderness. 
 
 
 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Prehospital provider assessment will determine what method is needed. Every patient with trauma 
must receive an assessment. If any assessment component is positive, the patient requires spinal motion 
restriction. 
 
Patients with severe kyphosis or other anatomical or medical conditions (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis or 
rheumatoid arthritis) may be stabilized using a combination of pillow, blanket,  or other devices.  
 
Spinal  motion  restriction  should  be  accomplished  using  the  most  appropriate  tool  for  the  specific  
circumstance.  May  include,   but  are  not  limited  to,   vacuum  splints,  pneumatic  splints,  cervical  collars,  
soft  collars,  straps,  tape,  as  well as  soft  materials,  such  as  pillows  and  blanket  to  minimize  movement,  
compression, or distraction of the spine. 
 
Patients  with  acute  or  chronic  difficulty  breathing:  Use  spinal  motion  restriction  with  caution  in 
patients presenting with dyspnea and place patient in position best suited to protect the airway.

ACTIVATED CHARCOAL 
 
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC 
 
Class 
• Antidote 
 
Mechanism of Action 
• Adsorbs a variety of drugs and chemicals (e.g., physical binding of a molecule to the surface of charcoal particles); 
desorption of bound particles may occur unless the ratio of charcoal to toxin is extremely high. 
 
Indications 
• Management of overdose and poisoning

ADENOSINE 
 
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC 
 
Classification 
• Antidysrhythmic 
 
Mechanism of Action 
• Slows conduction through the AV node and interrupts AV reentry pathways as well as conduction through the SA 
nodes. 
 
Indications 
• Management of    supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) 
• Protocols: S-127, S-1 63 
 
Contraindications  
• Second- or third-degree AV block ( without 
pacemaker) 
• Sick sinus syndrome 
 
Adult Dose 
• Adenosine 6 mg rapid IV/IO followed by 20 mL NS 
rapid IV/IO 
• If no conversion, adenosine 12 mg rapid IV/IO 
followed by 20 mL NS rapid IV/IO, MR x1 
Pediatric Dose 
• Adenosine per drug chart rapid IV/IO, followed with 
20 mL NS rapid IV/IO, MR x2 
 
Adverse Effects 
• Flushing 
• Sweating 
• Dizziness 
• Nervousness 
 
•   Hypotension 
•   Feeling of impending doom 
•   Severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma 
• Paresthesia 
 
Notes 
• For stable patients, use Valsalva maneuver prior to administration. Discontinue Valsalva maneuver after 5-10 
seconds if no conversion.  
• Ideally, cannulate a proximal vein with an 18-20g catheter. Use the IV port closest to the patient and rapidly f lush 
with 20mL normal saline immediately. 
• Run a 6-second ECG strip before, during, and after drug administration. 
• Patients frequently have a brief period of escape beats or asystole before the sinus node starts up again. This may 
be perceived as a feeling of impending death and can be extremely frightening for patients. 
• If the wide-complex tachycardia is ventricular in origin, adenosine is highly unlikely to result in cardioversion. 
• Bronchospasm may occur in patients with a history of airway disease, such as asthma or COPD.

injuries, continuous albuterol/levalbuterol per drug 
chart via nebulizer 
 
Adverse Effects 
• Tremors 
• Headache 
• Nervousness 
• Dizziness 
• Dry mouth 
 
• Dysrhythmias 
• Chest discomfort 
• Palpitations 
• Nausea/vomiting 
 
Notes 
• Ineffective in croup and should be avoided. 
• Pediatric patients between 2-6 years of age may be more prone to adverse effects. 
• Do not assume patients have administered their own drug properly. Do not include home doses of 
albuterol/levalbuterol in your total drug administration consideration. 
• If concerned about aerosolized infectious exposure, substitute with MDI, if available. 
• Patients may need to be instructed on proper use of the MDI. 
• Levalbuterol may be substituted for albuterol and can be combined with ipratropium bromide. This substitution 
option applies to patients ≥6 years of age.

Notes 
• May omit atropine in bradycardic patients unlikely to have clinical benefit (e.g., heart transplant patients, second-
degree type II, or third-degree heart block). 
• Use cautiously if myocardial infarction or ischemia is suspected, as atropine will increase myocardial oxygen
 
demand, which may worsen the infarct. 
• In organophosphate poisoning, titrate atropine to SLUDGE/BBB signs/symptoms, not to tachycardia. Cardiac 
monitoring should be considered in all cases of severe organophosphate poisoning.

Notes 
• Remember to consider non-pharmacologic pain treatments, e.g., place in position of comfort, apply ice packs/splints 
PRN, and verbal reassurance. 
• Closely monitor respiratory status (including capnography) after administration. 
• An initial dose of 100 mcg IV or 50 mcg IN is well tolerated in most adults. 
• In opioid-naive or elderly patients, start with a lower dose. For elderly patients not taking opioids, 25 mcg is 
frequently sufficient for pain relief. Consider beginning with 25 mcg and titrating up in increments of 25 mcg to 
achieve pain relief without respiratory depression.
  
• For pediatric patients >36 kg or longer than the LBRT, rather than administering the maximum dose, use weight-
based dosing for both initial and repeat doses. It is acceptable to round doses (up or down) to the nearest 5 mcg.

NITROGLYCERIN 
 
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC 
 
Classification 
• Nitrate, anti-anginal 
 
Mechanism of Action 
• N itrate enters vascular smooth muscle and is converted to nitric oxide leading to vasodilation. Relaxes smooth 
muscle via dose-dependent dilation of arterial and venous beds:  reduces both preload, afterload, and myocardial 
oxygen demand. Also improves coronary collateral circulation. Lowers blood pressure, increases heart rate and 
occasionall y causes paradoxical bradycardia. 
 
Indications 
• M anagement of discomfort/pain of cardiac origin and 
acute pulmonary edema 
• Protocols: S-126, S-136 
Contraindications  
• U se of erectile dysfunction or pulmonary 
hypertension medications within last 48 hours 
• Suspected intracranial bleed 
 
Adult Dose 
• For discomfort/pain of    cardiac origin if SBP ≥100 
mmHg, NTG 0.4 mg SL, MR q3-5 min 
• For CHF 
• If systolic BP ≥100 but <150: NTG 0.4 mg SL, MR 
q3-5 min 
• If systolic BP ≥150: NTG 0.8 mg SL, MR q3-5 min 
Pediatric Dose 
• Not indicated for use in pediatrics 
 
Adverse Effects 
• Headache 
• D izziness 
• Weakness 
• R eflex tachycardia 
• Syncope 
 
• H ypotension 
• N ausea/vomiting 
 
 
Notes 
• EMT: Authorized to assist patient to self-medicate   own prescribed NTG only. 
• Examples of erectile dysfunction medications include sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra). 
• Examples of pulmonary hypertension medications include sildenafil (Revatio) and epoprostenol sodium (Flolan, 
Veletri). 
• Nitroglycerin is used primarily to provide pain relief from anginal chest discomfort. 
• A ssess the patient and document vital signs, including pain scale, before and after each administration.

ONDANSETRON 
 
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC 
 
Classification 
• Antiemetic, selective 5-HT3 antagonist 
 
Mechanism of Action 
• M echanism of action unclear; believed to function via serotonin antagonism at central and/or peripheral receptors. 
Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3 type are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the 
chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area of the medullary structure that controls vomiting. May cause prolongation of 
the QT interval. 
 
Indications 
• M anagement of nausea or vomiting 
• Protocols: S-120, S-139, S-169, S-174 
Contraindications  
• Known or suspected long QT syndrome 
• <6 months of age 
 
Adult Dose 
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV/IM/ODT, MR x1 in 10 min 
Pediatric Dose 
• Ondansetron IV/IM/ODT per drug chart 
 
Adverse Effects 
• Headache 
• Syncope 
• Wheezing 
• Bronchospasm 
 
• Dysrhythmias 
• ECG changes 
• Palpitations 
 
• Hives 
• Skin rash 
 
Notes 
• ECG changes include dose-dependent QT prolongation and ST-segment depression. 
• May cause serotonin syndrome if co-administered with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., 
fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine.

SODIUM BICARBONATE 
 
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC 
 
Classification 
• Alkalizing agent, antidote 
 
Mechanism of Action 
• Increases blood and urinary pH by neutralizing hydrogen ion concentration. 
 
Indications 
• M anagement of hyperkalemia, tricyclic 
antidepressant overdose, and specific crush injuries 
• Protocols: S-127, S-1 31, S-134, S-139, S-163,        
S-165, S-169 
Contraindications  
 
Adult Dose 
• NaHCO
3
 1 mEq/kg IV/IO 
Pediatric Dose 
• NaHCO
3
 per drug chart IV/IO 
 
Adverse Effects 
• Electrolyte imbalance 
• Pulmonary edema (secondary to sodium overload) 
• Tremors 
• Twitching 
• Seizures (caused by alkalosis) 
 
Notes 
• Monitor the patient closely for signs and symptoms of fluid overload. Because the buffering action produces carbon 
dioxide, ensure the patient has adequate airway and ventilatory support. 
• May precipitate or inactivate other medications; flush the IV line well before and after administering sodium 
bicarbonate. For example, precipitates to form calcium carbonate (chalk) when used with calcium chloride. 
Administer calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate in separate IV/IO or thoroughly flush in between 
administrations using at least 10 mL of normal saline.

TRANEXAMIC ACID 
 
EMT AEMT PARAMEDIC 
 
Classification 
• Hemostatic agent, antifibrinolytic agent, plasminogen inhibitor 
 
Mechanism of Action 
• Prevents clot breakdown by inhibiting the activation of plasminogen, which reduces the conversion of plasminogen 
to plasmin (enzyme that halts the clotting process). Increases fibrin formation, which impedes blood flow for the 
formation of a clot.

MI, DVT, PE) 
• Potential need for reimplantation 
• Mechanism of injury or delivery more than 3 hours 
prior to EMS care 
 
Adult Dose 
• Tranexamic acid 1 gm/10 mL IV/IO, in 50-100 mL 
NS, over 10 min 
Pediatric Dose 
• Not indicated for use in pediatrics 
 
Adverse Effects 
• Headache 
• Dizziness 
 
Notes 
• Rapid infusion may cause hypotension; administer over 10 minutes. 
• Slow infusion rate if nausea, vomiting, or near syncope occurs. 
• May increase the risk of thromboembolic disorders.

Transportation and Destination Guidelines 
Pediatric patients who meet criteria outlined in T-460 (Identification of the Pediatric Trauma Center Patient) 
should be transported to the Designated Pediatric Trauma Center, except in the following situations.   
1. Adult with child 
a.   If there is a single ambulance (air/ground) with both a pediatric trauma center patient and an adult 
trauma center patient, the ambulance should first transport the more critical patient to the appropriate 
facility. If both patients are critical, or if there are other questions, both may be transported to the 
designated adult trauma center. 
b.   Field personnel should consider splitting the team using additional ALS transport vehicles, or 
aeromedical resources to transport the pediatric patient to the pediatric trauma facility and the adult 
patient to the catchment area trauma facility. 
2. Trauma center diversion  
The pediatric patient who is identified as a trauma patient shall be transported to the designated pediatric 
trauma center. When the pediatric trauma center is on diversion, including age-specific diversion, the 
pediatric patient shall be transported to the county-designated backup pediatric trauma center, the 
University of California, San Diego (UCSD). 
3. Pregnant pediatric patient 
A pediatric pregnant trauma patient shall be transported to UCSD.

• Taser discharge for simple behavioral control is usually benign and does not require transport to BEF 
for evaluation. 
• Patients who are injured; appear to be under the influence of drugs; or present with altered mental         
status or symptoms of illness should have medical evaluation performed by EMS personnel before 
being transported to BEF. 
• If barbs are impaled in anatomically sensitive location such as eye, face, neck, finger/hand, or 
genitalia, do not remove the barb. Transport patient to BEF. 
 
†
For severely agitated or combative patients, IN or IM midazolam is the preferred route to decrease risk of 
injury to the patient and personnel.  
 
Alert: Co-administration of midazolam in patients with alcohol intoxication can cause respiratory 
depression. Consider avoiding or reducing midazolam dose.

Transportation and Destination Guidelines 
Pediatric patients who meet criteria outlined in T-460 (Identification of the Pediatric Trauma Center Patient) should be 
transported to the Designated Pediatric Trauma Center, except in the following situations.  
1. Adult with child 
a.    If there is a single ambulance (air/ground) with both a pediatric trauma center patient and an adult trauma center 
patient, the ambulance should first transport the more critical patient to the appropriate facility. If both patients are 
critical, or if there are other questions, both may be transported to the designated adult trauma center. 
b.    Field personnel should consider splitting the team using additional ALS transport vehicles, or aeromedical 
resources to transport the pediatric patient to the pediatric trauma facility and the adult patient to the catchment 
area trauma facility. 
2. Trauma center diversion  
The pediatric patient who is identified as a trauma patient shall be transported to the designated pediatric trauma 
center. When the pediatric trauma center is on diversion, including age-specific diversion, the pediatric patient shall 
be transported to the county-designated backup pediatric trauma center, the University of California, San Diego 
(UCSD). 
3. Pregnant pediatric patient 
A pediatric pregnant trauma patient shall be transported to UCSD.

*Taser barb considerations  
• Taser discharge for simple behavioral control is usually benign and does not require transport to BEF for 
evaluation. 
• Patients who are injured; appear to be under the influence of drugs; or present with altered mental status or 
symptoms of illness should have medical evaluation performed by EMS personnel before being transported to 
BEF. 
• If barbs are impaled in anatomically sensitive location such as eye, face, neck, finger/hand, or genitalia, do not 
remove the barb. Transport patient to BEF. 
 
†
For severely agitated or combative patients, IN or IM midazolam is the preferred route to decrease risk of injury to 
the patient and personnel.  
 
 
Alert: Co-administration of midazolam in patients with alcohol intoxication can cause respiratory depression. 
Consider avoiding or reducing midazolam dose.
