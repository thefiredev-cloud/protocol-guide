ALS and BLS protocols are to be utilized by EMS personnel and as a resource for Base\n     Hospital physicians to become familiar with local EMS patient care.  All procedures and/or\n     medications must be within the scope of practice for field personnel and authorized in Solano\n     EMS policies.\n\n2.                         All ALS and BLS protocols are intended to be used as guidelines and are not a substitute for\n     sound medical judgment.  Unusual patient presentations make it impossible to develop a\n     protocol for every possible patient situation.\n\n3.                         Disrupted Communications:  In the event that a Solano County paramedic is unable to make\n     physician contact for orders, the paramedic may not utilize those areas of the protocols\n     requiring physician direction and must transport immediately to the closest receiving facility.\n\n4.                         Base Hospital Contact:  Paramedics are expected to use sound medical judgment in caring\n     for every patient.  Solano County EMS Protocols give paramedics wide latitude in deciding\n     when to make Base Contact.  Base physician contact is always available and should be\n     utilized in the following circumstances:\n\n                a.                         Any time Base Hospital contact is required in a protocol.\n                b.                         Unusual patient situations not covered in a protocol.\n                c.                           Situations where deviation from a protocol appears to be in the patient’s best\n                      interest.\n                d.                         For any patient attended by a physician on the scene (see Policy 6510).\n                e.                         For any patient who is Refusing Medical Assistance that, in the judgment of the\n                      paramedic, should be treated and/or transported to a hospital.\n                f.                                   Out-of-protocol medication administration.  In some situations it may be\n                      appropriate to utilize medications carried by paramedics for indications not\n                      covered an one of the Solano EMS ALS Protocols.  Examples include:  sodium\n                      bicarbonate for tricyclic antidepressant overdose or renal failure patient with\n                      presumed hyperkalemia; glucagon for beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker\n                      overdose; calcium chloride for hydrofluoric acid exposure, calcium channel\n                      blocker overdose, or renal failure patient with presumed hyperkalemia; albuterol\n                      nebulizer for possible hyperkalemia;  diphenhydramine for acute dystonic\n                      reaction; high-dose atropine for organophosphate exposure.\n                g.                         Paramedics may contact another Base Hospital if they are not able to contact the\n                      original Base Hospital physician for orders.  This may occasionally occur due to\n                      hospital equipment failure or if the original Base Hospital is unable to handle the\n                      call.",

This requirement may be waived by providing documentation of a\n                           minimum of five (5) but no more than ten (10) ALS calls during a\n                           Paramedic education program field internship with a Solano County ALS\n                           Provider within the previous six (6) months.\n                  5.   The EMS Medical Director, or EMS Agency designee, shall evaluate the calls\n                       submitted to the EMS Agency to ensure that EMS Agency policy and protocol\n                       were followed and to evaluate the quality of patient care given.  If it is\n                       demonstrated in this evaluation that the Paramedic applicant did not perform\n                       treatment as outlined in policy/protocol, the Paramedic applicant may be\n                       required to report back to his preceptor for further instruction or calls.  The\n                       call documentation will also be submitted back to the Paramedic’s precepting\n                       provider for further Quality Improvement review.\n                  6.   The EMS Medical Director shall evaluate any Paramedic applicant who fails\n                       to successfully complete the field evaluation and may recommend further\n                       evaluation or training.  If during the field evaluation, the applicant’s proficiency\n                       in the scope of practice comes into question, then the qualification of the\n                       individual to hold a license becomes an issue and the Solano County EMS\n                       Agency shall evaluate the situation for appropriate action including, but not\n                       limited to, forwarding to the State EMS Authority for further review.\n         D.

If a Paramedic is issued a Solano County Paramedic Number prior to\n                             attending the EMS Agency orientation and fails to attend the next\n                             scheduled orientation, the Paramedic will be issued a mandatory notice to\n                             attend the next orientation.  If the Paramedic fails to attend a second\n                             scheduled orientation, the Paramedic’s accreditation will be suspended\n                             until the orientation until the orientation is attended.\n                         b.  If the EMS Agency cancels an EMS Agency orientation Paramedics will\n                             not be penalized.\n                5.  An applicant who fails to complete the accreditation process may not practice as\n                    a Paramedic in Solano County.\n                6.

MEDICAL MANAGEMENT at the scene of a medical emergency should be\n                   handled in the following manner: Responsibility – Upon arrival of the first\n                   responder, one person, usually the most medically qualified (subject to\n                   departmental policy), assumes responsibility for care of the patient. Turnover of\n                   responsibility – The first responder continues responsibility for patient care until\n                   arrival of an Advanced Life Support (ALS) agency, at which time first responder\n                   provides a verbal or written report to ALS personnel.  This report should include\n                   patient assessment, findings, and emergency care rendered prior to arrival of the\n                   ALS agency. This policy does not supersede Policy 6140 Responsibility\n                   for/Transfer of Patient Care.\n                   A.                                                                                  Acceptance of responsibility – ALS Fire Agency or ALS transport ambulance\n                                      unit shall assume responsibility for patient care after receiving a verbal or\n                                      written report from the first responder.  If written reports of first responder\n                                      care are not made available to transporting agency, it is the responsibility of\n                                      the first responder agency to ensure medical records of the first responder\n                                      care are made available to the hospital receiving the patient.\n                   B.                                                                                  The first responder unit should routinely remain on the scene until the\n                                      transport ambulance unit arrives and transfer of patient care has been\n                                      completed.  If it is determined that medical service is not needed, ambulance\n                                      response should be canceled according to “Cancellation of Ambulance\n                                      Response,” Policy #5400.

It was approved by the Solano\ncounty Health Officer/EMS Medical Director and is eff ective on or before August 1, 1993.  The purpose of the\nform is to provide a standardized format to document  Prehospital care, to provide standardized language for\nradio communication and to provide an instrument for  the gathering of data for evaluation and EMS system\nproductivity.  Additionally, this form is to be used on   all patient contacts including non-critical, pre-scheduled\npatient transfers and patient contacts which do not result  in transport.  (See Solano County Policy #6100).  The\nfollowing directions are a step-by-step procedure for filli ng out the form.  Please read the instructions carefully\nand refer to the attached examples illustrating the prope  r use of the forms.  These instructions are also\ndesigned to provide you with new information about docum  enting the patient encounter.  Remember that even\nthe most skilled and conscientious health care professiona l may have to go to court as a witness or even a\ndefendant.  In these circumstances the best protection is a thorough and accurate medical record.  Be precise\nand as detailed as possible.  A medical record may beco me a legal document that reflects upon its author.  Any\nquestions about the form or its use may be directed  to the Solano County EMS Agency office at (707) 784-\n8155.\n\nPATIENT INFORMATION SECTION\n\n1.

There may be a need to initiate ALS care for these cases, but Base consult is indicated\n                 because the need is only for patient comfort and relief.  There is usually no concern for loss of life or\n                 limb associated with EMS care rendered.  Immediate ALS intervention is not commonly indicated\n                 without Base consultation except fo r extraordinary circumstances.\n\n\n\n\nS/Policies & Procedures/6000Series/6100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      6100-8SUBJECT:  Patient Care Report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       POLICY:  6100\n\n\n         •                                        DOA (non-resuscitation case – these cases are classified under EMS Policy #6140, Determination of\n                  Death.\n         •                                        Unable to Classify – EMT-P unable to determine condition;  should be an exceptional case.\n32.

COMPLETION OF ELECTRONIC PCR FILE OR PAPER PCR\n         A call is not completed and a patient is not considered transferred to a physician’s\n         care until a PCR is completed and a copy provided to a receiving facility.  An EMS\n         unit is not available for pre-scheduled transfers until all records of medical care are\n         provided to the physician caring for the patient.  In the event an EMS unit needs to\n         be dispatched to another emergency call, the EMS team may be released from\n         their obligation to complete required medical records at that time. The treating\n         EMS crew must provide the treating physician a way to contact them directly\n         before leaving the receiving facility to allow the treating physician to ask additionalPolicy 6110                       Required Medical Records                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Date:  August 17, 2011\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        For Patient Care\n\n        questions that only the EMS crew can answer. This may be accomplished via\n        cellular phone or via radio.\n        In the event the EMS team responds to another emergency call without completing\n        required medical records, the team must complete the PCR and fax as soon as\n        possible, but in no case shall it be longer than 24 hours to submit the PCR to the\n        appropriate medical facility. Failure to complete medical records is deemed\n        abandonment.\n\nV.                                            DISTRIBUTION OF PAPER PCR FORM\n        A.                                           Provider Copy (1st Layer) – This is the original record maintained by the\n                Ambulance Service Provider.  For medical/legal purposes it is considered the\n                master medical record and all other PCR layers are copies of the master.  It is\n                the responsibility of the Provider to maintain these patient records in\n                accordance with medical liability statues.\n        B.                                           Patient Medical Record Copy (2nd Layer) – This is the copy of the PCR that is\n                retained by the receiving facility. In most cases this will be the receiving\n                hospital or medical facility.  In special cases this layer of the medical record\n                may be left with public safety officials or other EMS/medical care providers\n                (e.g., coroner’s office for Dead-On-Arrivals (DOAs), nursing care facilities\n                during transfers, medical staff at diagnostic facilities such as: Cardiac Cath\n                Lab, CT Scan, Radiography, etc.).\n        C.                                         EMS Copy (3rd Layer) – This is the Local EMS Agency copy of the medical\n                record utilized for statistical data processing.

GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR MEDICAL RECORD DOCUMENTATION\n        Information needed to complete a PCR is dependent upon multiple sources and\n        cannot always be precise and consistent (e.g., patient history, non-standardized\n        clocks, multiple dispatch centers, inability to have a scribe on scene, multiple\n        agencies responding to the scene incident, etc).  PCRs are completed with EMTs\n        making a good faith effort to appropriately and adequately complete accurate\n        patient record keeping requirements.\n        If it is determined that any person alters or modifies a medical record, dispatch log,\n        or any other EMS Quality Improvement documentation with fraudulent intent, or\n        creates a false medical record either by including fraudulent information (e.g., vital\n        signs reported but not taken) or omission/exclusion of essential information (e.g.,\n        missed IV or ETT attempts that are not recorded); this person is in violation of\n        471.5 of the California Penal Code and is subject to formal disciplinary action\n        under 1798.200 of the California State Health & Safety Code.\n        If situations arise where there are multiple sources of documentation, the\n        documentation provide by the individual(s) who actually performed the\n        assessment, skill, treatment, etc. shall be the official legal document of record.Policy 6110                       Required Medical Records                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Date:  August 17, 2011\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        For Patient Care\n\n\nVIII.

ECG MONITORING STRIP\n         If ECG monitoring or a 12 lead EKG is a part of the patient’s care and/or\n         assessment, at a minimum one EKG strip or 12 lead EKG must be attached to the\n         PCR either paper or electronic version of the PCR. The ECG strip or 12 lead EKG\n         should be at least a six-second strip, with date and time noted on the strip.\n         Multiple EKG strips or 12 lead EKGs should be sequential with the date and time\n         noted as appropriate.  Multiple EKGs or 12 lead EKGs should be attached to the\n         PCR and submitted to the Receiving Facility and EMS Agency.\n\nX.

Application\n          A.        This policy applies to any patient who refuses medical assistance or transportation.\n                     The paramedic shall document the patient’s refusal on the PCR and obtain a Refusal\n                     of Medical Assistance form that is signed by the patient or the person legally designated to\n                     make decisions regarding the health care for the patient.\n          B.           Only one Refusal of Medical Assistance Form is necessary for each patient.\n          C.           The patient should initiate any discussion regarding refusal of care and/or transport.\n          D.        All questions asked by the patient or the patient’s legal medical decision maker related to\n                     cost or appropriateness of care should be answered to the best of the paramedic’s ability and\n                     documented on the PCR.\n\n\nIV.        PATIENTS ALLOWED REFUSAL OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE\n          A.        In order to be competent to refuse medical assistance, a patient must be able to\n                     understand and to demonstrate an understanding of the nature and consequences of refusing\n                     medical care.\n\n\nS/Policies & Procedures/6000Series/6125                                                                                                                               6125-3SUBJECT:      REFUSAL OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE                                                                                POLICY: 6125\n                                                                                                                                                                   DATE:  July 25, 2006\n\n\n          B.        The following patients are allowed to refuse medical assistance:\n                     1.      A competent adult\n                     2.      A minor patient who meets the definition of adult as defined in section II.D.\n                             above\n                     3.      A competent parent or guardian on behalf of a minor.\n                     4.

Some adult patients may make a decision to refuse care that EMS personnel feel\n                             is irrational, but the patient is felt to be otherwise competent.  If the EMT-P is\n                             concerned that the patient is not making decisions as a reasonable person would\n                             in the same situation, the EMT-P should attempt to prevail upon the patient to\n                             consent to treatment.  Other resources which may be useful in convincing the\n                             patient to agree to care include:\n                             a.      Enlist family members to assist in convincing the patient to consent to care\n                             b.      Contact a base hospital physician to speak with the patient directly\n                             c.      Law enforcement personnel may be able to convince the patient or place\n                                      them on a 5150 hold when appropriate\n\n\nV.              PATIENTS NOT ALLOWED REFUSAL OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE/TRANSPORT\n          A.        Minor patients except as defined in section II.D. above.\n          B.        In the following situations, when a patient is refusing care, intervention of law\n                     enforcement personnel is indicated to determine whether the provisions of the policy\n                     regarding a 5150 hold should apply.\n                     1.      Any patient who presents with altered level of consciousness\n                     2.      Any patient who has attempted suicide, or verbalizes suicidal intent\n                     3.      Any patient whose judgment is impaired due to drugs/ETOH\n          C.        Patients who are on a 5150 hold are not allowed to/cannot refuse transportation or\n                     emergency medical care, but may refuse treatment for non-emergency conditions.\n          D.        Law enforcement personnel can also assist in making appropriate disposition of minors\n                     who are refusing transportation, but do not meet the requirements for a 5150 hold.\n\n\nVI.      Process:\n          A.        Determine that the individual meets the definition of a patient and is competent to refuse\n                     care and sign the Refusal of Medical Assistance Form\n          B.        Clearly offer both treatment and transportation to the hospital.\n          C.           Attempt to perform a physical assessment that includes a complete set of vital signs\n          D.        Obtain and document a history of the event that led to the 911 call.

Determine that the patient has an understanding of the risks and benefits of treatment\n                     and transport.\n          H.        Advise the patient or the patient’s legally designated medical decision maker to seek\n                     medical attention for any and all medical complaints.\n          I.

Refusal of Medical Assistance (RMA) Form (Atch 2):\n                     1.      Prepare and explain the RMA Form to the patient or the patient’s designated medical\n                              decision maker.\n                     2.       Have the patient or the patient’s legal representative sign the RMA Form.\n                     3.      The signature of the patient or the patients legally designated medical    decision\n                              maker should be witnessed if possible.\n                     4.      The paramedic should attempt to have a preferred witness sign the RMA Form.\n                              Preferred witnesses include:\n                              a.

An EMS provider that has not filled out the PCR\n                     5.      Should the patient refuse to sign the RMA Form, two individuals who witnessed the\n                              interaction should sign the RMA Form and there should be documentation of the\n                              circumstances surrounding the refusal of service on the PCR.\n                     6.      If the patient leaves the scene or refuses to listen to the explanations involved in\n                              obtaining the RMA Form, the circumstances will be carefully documented on the\n                              PCR and no RMA Form will be completed.\n          M.

Special Situations\n          A.          All special circumstances will be documented on the PCR.\n          B.        If a patient with an emergent medical condition is refusing care and appears competent, a\n                     base hospital physician consultation must be obtained with the hope that the physician will\n                     speak with the patient and be able to convince the patient to consent to care.\n          C.           In order for a non-English speaking patient to refuse care an explanation must be provided and\n                     instructions given in the patients own language by the paramedic or through an interpreter.\n          D.        If the patient or the patient’s legally designated medical decision maker is unable to read\n                     the form, the Refusal of Medical Assistance Form should be read to the patient in the\n                     appropriate language.\n          E.        If a parent or the patients legally designated medical decision maker refuses care and has\n                     no immediate plan for care of a minor child, elder or dependent adult who is in distress, paramedics\n                     shall request law enforcement assistance.\n          F.

EMS Service Provider shall submit the audit summary to their Provider Medical\n                     Director if it determines that any of the medical audit criteria were present and a Base\n                     Hospital consult did not occur.\n          E.        Reporting Requirements:  At the end of each month, each EMS Service Provider shall\n                     submit actual audits and/or a computerized data file of the months’ RMA audits in\n                     conjunction with the PCRs that are submitted to the Solano EMS Agency office.\n\n\n                                                # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS/Policies & Procedures/6000Series/6125                                                                                                                               6125-6                                                                                                                                                                             DATE:  July 25, 2006\nATCH 1:  REFUSAL OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROCEDURE\n\n\n\n\n              Definition of Patient Met                    No             RMA POLICY DOES\n                                                                          NOT APPLY.

EXPOSURE REPORTING\n               Section 1797.188 of the Health and Safety Code requires hospitals to notify the\n               County Health Officer when EMS personnel have been exposed to an infectious\n               disease.  The Ryan White Act requires medical facilities to notify the designated\n               officer when emergency response employees are exposed to specified infectious\n               diseases during the transport of a patient to the hospital.\n               The law further states that it is the responsibility of EMS personnel to provide\n               information to the receiving hospital when they perceive that a significant\n               exposure has occurred, (e.g., oral contact to blood or body fluids, including but\n               not limited to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation; blood splash in the face; or\n               accidental needle stick.)\n               A. Transported Cases\n                               All EMS Personnel, including Police and Fire Department Personnel,\n                               should report any significant exposure to the hospital where the patient\n                               was transported.  Reporting forms are available in all of the Hospital\n                               Emergency Departments (see attachment A).  The form should be turned\n                               into the Base Hospital Liaison Nurse, Charge/Lead Nurse, or the\n                               Infectious Disease Nurse and/or designee at the receiving hospital. The\n                               exposed individual shall keep a copy of the exposure report for their\n                               record.  Significant exposures to positive infectious disease sources will\n                               be followed-up on by each hospital and reported to the “designated officer”\n                               of the agency involved.  Individual calls from emergency response\n                               personnel will not be answered.\n               B. Non-Transported Cases\n                               Exposure cases involving a non-transported victim (Coroner’s case,\n                               Against Medical Advice [AMA], etc., must be reported on an Exposure\n                               Form [Attachment A]).

A new sample may not be obtained.  The source patient or\n                                      authorized legal representative of the source patient shall be informed\n                                      that an available blood sample or other tissue or material will be tested\n                                      despite his or her refusal, and that the exposed individual shall be\n                                      informed of the HIV test results.

Utilize  “kerlex”  type  bandages  rather  than  adhesive  bandages  in  treating  wounds.\n     F.        Provide  oxygen  by  mask  for  any  victim  with  respiratory  problems.\n     G.        Continue  to  rinse  irritated eyes with water while enroute to hospital and be alert for\n               respiratory distress.  USE BASINS TO SAVE THE WATER USED FOR RINSING.\n     H.        Cover  entire  gurney,  including  pillow,  with  a  disposable  (plastic  lined)  blanket.\n     I.        Cover patient compartment floor with a  disposable  (plastic  lined)  blanket.    Do  this  either\n               before  initially  arriving  or  before  you  re-enter  vehicle  in  order  to  minimize  contamination\n               from shoes.  Not necessary in all cases (e.g., gas exposure).\n     J.        Write  down  the  name  of  the  involved  chemicals,  if  identified,  before  leaving  the  scene.SUBJECT:        Ambulance Response to Hazardous Materials Spills                                                       POLICY: 6200\n                                                                                                                    DATE:  06/01/91\n\n\n\n\n     K.

Concentrated acids may cause sever skin burns.  Generally, these substances have\nvery  good  warning  properties:    even  fairly  low  airborne  concentrations of acids produce rapid\nonset  of  eye,  nose  and  throat  irritation.    Higher  concentrations  can  produce  cough,  shortness  of\nbreath,  wheezing,  chemical  pneumonia  or  non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Occasionally,\npulmonary edema may be delayed for several   hours,   especially   with   low-solubility  gases  such  as\nnitrogen  oxides  produced  from  nitric  acid.    Ingestion  of  acids  can  result  in  severe  injury  to  the\nupper  airway,  esophagus  and  stomach.\n\n\nNotes on Ammonia (Liquid and Gas)\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAmmonia  (NH3) is a direct irritant and alkaline corrosive agent to moist mucous membranes and,\nto  a  lesser  extent,  to  intact  skin.    Ammonia  has  very  good  warning  properties.    Even  fairly  low\nairborne  concentrations  produce  rapid  onset  of  eye,  nose  and  throat  irritation.  Higher\nconcentrations  can  produce  cough,  shortness  of  breath,  wheezing,  chemical  pneumonia  or  non-\ncardiogenic  pulmonary  edema.    The  onset  of  pulmonary  edema  is  usually  rapid  but  may\noccasionally  be  delayed  for  12-24 hours.  Ingestion of concentrated ammonia solutions (e.g.,\n>5%)  may  cause  serious  corrosive  injury  to  the  esophagus  and  stomach.\n\n\nNotes on Chlorine Gas\n\nBACKGROUND\nChlorine  is  a  highly  irritating  gas  which  rapidly  forms  hydrochloric  acid  after  contact  with  the\nmoist  mucous  membranes  in  the  upper  airway  and  in  the  lungs.    Symptoms  occur  rapidly  and\nprovide good warning properties for exposure.  Low concentrations produce eye, nose and throat\nirritation.    Higher  concentrations  produce  cough,  shortness  of  breath,  wheezing,  choking,\nchemical  pneumonitis,  or  pulmonary  edema.    Ingestion  of  concentrated  hypochlorite  (bleach)\nsolutions  can  cause  serious  corrosive  injury  to  the  esophagus  and  stomach.\n\n\n INITIAL DECONTAMINATION PRIOR TO PREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT:\n\nDecontamination   when   necessary   should   include  flushing  the  victim  with  water  spray,  and  if\nclothing  has  been  soaked  or  gas  is  likely  to  be  trapped  in  clothing,  the  clothing  should  be\nremoved,   double-bagged and skin flushed for 1 – 2 minutes.  With Acids, Acid Mists and\nAmmonia,  injured  eyes  should be  irrigated.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL  FOR  SECONDARY  CONTAMINATION:\nSmall  amounts  of  acid  mists,  ammonia  vapor  or  chlorine  gas  can  be  trapped  in  clothing  after  an\noverwhelming  exposure  but  are  usually  not  sufficient  to  create  a  hazard  for  health  care  personnelSUBJECT:        Ambulance Response to Hazardous Materials Spills                                                         POLICY: 6200\n                                                                                                                      DATE:  06/01/91\n\naway from  the  scene.    However,  skin  or  clothing  which  has  become  exposed  to  the  liquid  may  be\ncorrosive  to  rescuers.    Once  the  victim  has  been  stripped  and  flushed  with  water,  there  is  no\nsignificant  risk  of  secondary  contamination.    Decontamination  is  not  necessary for victims with\ninhalation  of  acid  mists  and  chlorine  gas  exposure  only.\nSUBJECT:        Ambulance Response to Hazardous Materials Spills                                                      POLICY: 6200\n                                                                                                                   DATE:  06/01/91\n\nPREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT AFTER INITIAL DECONTAMINATION:\n\n      ACIDS & ACID MISTS                                  AMMONIA                                  CHLORINE     GAS\n (NOT including Hydrofluoric Acid)\nFORMS: Gas, Liquid (Variable                FORMS: Gas (anhydrous) and liquid            FORMS: Gas (anhydrous) or liquid\nConcentrations) mixtures with water         (aqueous solutions, variable                 (aqueous chlorine usually in the form\nand aerosolized dusts.                      concentrations).

It is a common  product  of  combustion  of  any\norganic  material  and  is  a  major  toxic  component  in  cases  of  smoke  inhalation.    Carbon  monoxide\ncauses  poisoning  by  interfering  with  the  binding  of  oxygen  to  hemoglobin  in  the  blood,\nmyoglobin  in  heart  and  muscle  tissue  and  possibly  by  interfering  with  oxygen  utilization  in  the\ncell.    Symptoms  of  progressively  worse  exposure  include,  in  order:  headache,  dizziness,\ngiddiness,  tinnitus,  nausea,  muscle  weakness,  chest  pain,  dyspnea,  syncope,  seizures  and  coma.\nCherry-red   skin coloration is not commonly seen (except post-mortem)  and  should  not  be  relied\nupon  for  diagnosis.    The  half-life  of  CO  in  the  blood  is  from  5  to  9  hours  when  the  victim  is\nbreathing  room  air,  compared  to  60 – 90 minutes when breathing 100% oxygen.\n\nPOTENTIAL  FOR  SECONDARY  CONTAMINATION:\nVery  small  amounts  of  CO  can  be  trapped  in  a  victim’s  clothing  after  an  overwhelming  exposure,\nbut  are  not  usually  sufficient  to  create  a  hazard  for  health  care  personnel  away  from  the  scene.\nDecontamination   is   not   necessary for CO exposure alone.\n\n\nNOTES  ON  SMOKE  INHALATION\n\nBACKGROUND:\nSmoke  inhalation  injury  results  from  the  combined  effects  of  the  various  inhaled  components  as\nwell  as  direct  thermal  injury  to  the  airway.    Common  toxic  components  of  smoke  include  carbon\nmonoxide, hydrogen cyanide, irritant gases such as acrolein, ammonia, hydrogen chloride,\nphosgene,  nitrogen  oxides,  metal  fumes  and  carbonaceious  particulates.    The  proportion  of  each\ncomponent  depends  on  the  substances  and  conditions  of  the  combustion.    Fires involving\nchemicals may produce smoke with very high concentrations of toxic substances.  Stridor,\nwheezing,  tracheobronchitis  and  acute  upper  airway  obstruction  may  occur  from  irritant  gases\nand thermal effects.  Acute non-cardiogenic  pulmonary  edema and chemical pneumonia may\noccur shortly after exposure or may be delayed up to several hours, especially after exposure to\nnitrogen  oxides.\n\nIn  any  victim  with  altered  mental  status,  suspect  inhalation  of  a  systemic  toxin  such  as  carbon\nmonoxide,  hydrogen  cyanide  (see  protocol),  agents  producing  methamoglobinemia  (see  protocol),\nor  smoke  containing  with  a  stored  chemical  such  as  pesticides  or  those  found  in  combustion  of\ndrug    laboratory    chemicals.\n\nPOTENTIAL  FOR  SECONDARY  CONTAMINATION:\nAlthough  small  quantities  of  acid,  amine  or  ammonia  mists  may  be  absorbed  onto  clothing  from\nsmoke,  they  pose  no  significant  risk  of  secondary  contamination  of  rescuers  outside  of  the  hot\nzone,  even  though  odor  and  carbon  deposits  may  be  a  nuisance.    If  the  victim  has  been exposed to\nheavy  concentrations  of  liquid  or  vapor  from  a  chemical,  then  removal  of  clothing  and  flushing\nwith  water  is  appropriate.\n\n\nINITIAL DECONTAMINATION PRIOR TO PREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT:SUBJECT:        Ambulance Response to Hazardous Materials Spills                                                    POLICY: 6200\n                                                                                                                 DATE:  06/01/91\n\nDecontamination   with   smoke   inhalation   should   include   removal   of contaminated clothing and\nflushing skin for 1 – 2 minutes if the victim has been exposed to a heavy concentration of liquid\nor  vapor  from  a  chemical.\nSUBJECT:      Ambulance Response to Hazardous Materials Spills                                       POLICY: 6200\n                                                                                                   DATE:  06/01/91\n\nPREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT AFTER INITIAL DECONTAMINATION\n\nSMOKE  INHALATION                                        CARBON MONOXIDE\nFORMS:            Toxic  Gases, vapors and               FORMS:             Gas\n\n                  particulates formed by\n                  combustion.\n\n                                          !

It  is\nused  widely  in  the  nicroelectronics  industry  and  occasionally  occurs  as  a  by-product in\nmetallurgy  and  pesticide  manufacturing.    Arsine’s  effects  are  quite  distinct  from  other  arsenic\ncompounds.    Even  in  very  small  quantities,  inhaled  arsine  produces  acute  hemolysis  (rupture  of\nred  blood  cells),  which  can  result  in  cardiac  decompensation  due  to  anemia, or renal failure due to\nmassive  kidney  deposition  of  hemoglobin.    Symptoms  may  be  delayed  for  2 – 24 hours, and\ninclude  weakness,  abdominal  and  flank  pain,  brown  urine  and  jaundice.    Massive  acute  exposure\nappears  capable  of  causing  immediate  death  by  an  unknown  mechanism.\n\n\nNOTES  ON  PHOSPHINE\n\nBACKGROUND:\nPhosphine  (PH3)  is  an  extremely  toxic  gas  with  a  nauseating  odor,  used  in  the  electronics\nindustry  as an  insect  fumigant,  and  occasionally  occurring  as  a  by-product  in  manufacturing.    Its\ntoxicology      is not well understood, but it appears to affect the central nervous system, the heart,\nlungs  and  liver.    Symptoms  flowing  low  to  moderate  exposure  include  nausea,  vomiting,\nheadache, cough, dizziness, diarrhea, muscle aches, fever and chills.  Severe exposure may\nproduce  shncope,  stupor,  coma,  pulmonary  edema  and  death.    Unlike  arsine,  phosphine  does  not\nproduce  hemolysis.\n\n\nINITIAL DECONTAMINATIO PROR TO PREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT:\nDecontamination  should  include  flushing  of  the  victim  with  water  spray,  and  if  gas  is  likely  to  be\ntrapped  in  clothing,  clothes  should  be  removed  and  double-bagged.\n\nPOTENTIAL  FOR  SECONDARY  CONTAMINATION:\nVery small amounts of arsine or phosphine can be trapped in a victim’s clothing after an\noverwhelming  exposure,  but  are  not  usually sufficient to create a hazard for health care personnel\naway  from  the  scene.    Therefore,  decontamination  of  the  victim  is  generally  not  required.\nSUBJECT:       Ambulance Response to Hazardous Materials Spills                                              POLICY: 6200\n                                                                                                          DATE:  06/01/91\n\nPREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT AFTER INITIAL DECONTAMINATION\n\nARSINE                                                       PHOSPHINE\nFORMS:       Gas,  may  be  generated  in  metal  ore        FORMS:         Gas.

Cyanide  gas  (HCN) is a major toxic component in cases of smoke\ninhalation.    CN  produces  toxicity  by  interfering  with  cellular  oxygen  utilization.    Symptoms  and\nsigns  include  headache,  dizziness,  vomiting,  tachypnea,  tachycardia,  and  coma.    There  may  be  a\ndistinctive  odor  (“bitter almonds”) on the victim’s clothing or breath.  Death can occur within\nminutes  of  exposure.    If  exposure  is  by  inhalation  of  CN  gas,  peak  toxic  effects  are  seen  within\nminutes,  but  after  ingestion  of  a  CN  salt  or  nitriles  and  other  compounds  that  can be metabolized\nto  form  CN,  the  onset  of  symptoms  may  be  delayed  for  several  hours.\n\n\nINITIAL DECONTAMINATION PRIOR TO PREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT:\nDecontamination  should  include  flushing  of  the  victim  with  water  spray,  and  if  gas  is  likely  to  be\ntrapped  in  clothing,  clothes  should  be  removed  and  double  bagged.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL  FOR  SECONDARY  CONTAMINATION:\nIf  the  exposure  was  by  inhalation  of  HCN  gas,  even  though  there  may  be  small  amounts  of  gas\ntrapped  in  clothing  after  an  overwhelming  exposure,  this  is  not  usually sufficient to create a\nhazard  for  health  care  personnel  away  from  the  scene.    The  risk  of  secondary  contamination  to\nrescuers  is  greater  if  there  is  liquid  or  solid  material  on  the  victim’s  clothing  or  skin.

Hydrogen sulfide may be found in oil refineries, natural gas drilling sits, sewage\nsludge,   liquid   manure   and   in   a variety  of  industry.    Mercaptans  are  sulfur-containing, highly\nodorous  compounds.    All  of  these  compounds  are  direct  irritants,  but  the  major  toxicity  is  due  to\ninterference with cellular oxygen utilization.  Low-level  exposures  produce  irritation  of  the  eyes,\nnose and throat, cough, headache, nausea and dizziness.  Higher exposures can cause syncope,\nseizures,  coma,  tracheobronchitis  and  pulmonary  edema  (which  may  occur  up  to  48-72  hours\nlater).

They  are  plant-derived  products\n(terpines)  such  as  citrus,  pine  and  eucalyptus  oils  are  also  included  in  this  group.\n\nInhalation of vapors may produce eye, nose and throat irritation, headache, dizziness, giddiness,\ndisorientation, altered mental status, nausea and weakness.  Intense exposure such as in an\nenclosed space   may   result   in   respiratory   depression,   unconsciousness,   convulsions   and   liver   or\nkidney  damage.    Prolonged  skin  exposure  may  cause  rash,  dryness  and  skin  burns.    Because  most\nare  lipid  soluble,  they  may  be  absorbed  through  the  skin.    Some  petroleum  distillates (e.g.,\nbenzene)  are  known  or  suspected  carcinogens.\n\nAspiration  into  the  lungs  may  occur  during  ingestion.    Pulmonary  aspiration  of  even  small\namounts  can  result  in  severe  chemical  pneumonia.    These  patients  usually    have  coughing,\ntachypnea and other  symptoms  of  respiratory  distress.\n\nNOTES ON HALOGENATED HYDROCARBON SOLVENTS (INCLUDING\nCHLORINATED SOLVENTS, DEGREASERS, PAINT STRIPPERS AND\nCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS).\n\nBACKGROUND\nThese  substances  are  commonly  used  in  industry  for  cleaning  and  degreasing electronic parts or\nmetal  or  other  surfaces,  for  dry  cleaning,  and  for  refrigeration.    Among  the  halogenated\nhydrocarbon  solvents  are  trichloroethylene,  perchloroethylene  (‘perc”),  methylene  chloride\n(dichlormethane),  1,1,1-trichloromethane  (methylchloroform),  Freons,  Halons  and  other\nchlorofluorocarbons.         Odor   varies   by   compound   and   in   general   is   not   a   good   warning   property.\n\nThese  solvents  are  well  absorbed  through  skin  or  the  lungs.    They  tend  to  be  excreted  rapidly,\nlargely  through  exhalation,  usually within a period of 15 minutes to a few hours.  Symptoms of\noverexposure  are  similar  to  those  listed  for  petroleum  distillates  above.  In  addition,  sensitization\nof  the  myocardium  may  result  in  cardiac  arrhythmias.    A  significant  concern  for  many  of  these\nagents  is  their  high  vapor  pressure  which,  in  confined  or  poorly  ventilated  spaces,  can  displace\noxygen   resulting   in   life   threatening   hypoxemia.      Methylene   chloride   (often   present   in   paint\nremovers)  deserves  special  attention  because  it  is  metabolized  to  carbon  monoxide  and  is\ncorrosive  to  skin  and  mucous  membranes.\n\nINITIAL DECONTAMINATION PRIOR TO PREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT:\nDecontamination  should  include  flushing  the  victim  with  water  spray,  clothes  should  be  removed\nand   double-bagged and skin flushed for 1 – 2 minutes.  Injured eyes should be irrigated.\n\nPOTENTIAL  FOR  SECONDARY  CONTAMINATION:\nIf  the  victim  was  only  exposed  to  hydrocarbon  or  solvent  vapors,  there  is  no  risk  of  secondary\ncontamination  of  downstream  personnel.    If  the  victim’s  clothing,  skin  or hair  is  soaked  with\nsolvent,  rescuers  can  be  contaminated  by  direct  contact  or,  more  importantly,  by  inhalation  of  off-SUBJECT:        Ambulance Response to Hazardous Materials Spills                                                        POLICY: 6200\n                                                                                                                     DATE:  06/01/91\n\ngassing  vapors.

A  variety  of  products  are  available,  with  widely  varying  potencies.    They  inhibit  the\nenzyme  cholinesterase,  resulting  in  buildup  of  excessive  acetylcholine.    Unlike\norganophosphates,  the  inhibition  of  cholinesterase  carbamates  is  transient  and  self-limited.\nSymptoms  and  signs  of  exposure  to  organophosphates  or  carbamates  include  hypersalivation,\nsweating,  bronchospasm,  abdominal  cramps,  diarrhea,  muscle weakness, small pupils, twitching\nand  seizures.    Death  is  due  to  respiratory  muscle  paralysis.    Nonspecific  symptoms  such  as  upper\nairway  irritation,  dizziness,  nausea  and  headache  after  inhalation  exposure  may  be  due  to  the\nsolvent  vehicle  (e.g.,  xylene) and not due to cholinesterase inhibition.  Potential toxicity of the\nsolvent  vehicle  should  always  be  considered  (see  protocol  for  petroleum  distillates).\n\n\nINITIAL DECONTAMINATION PROR TO PREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT:\nDecontamination   should   include   flushing   the  victim  with  water  spray,  clothing  should  be\nremoved   and   double-bagged and skin flushed for 1 – 2 minutes.  Injured eyes should be irrigated.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL  FOR  SECONDARY  CONTAMINATION:\nMany carbamates and organophosphates are well-absorbed   through   intact   skin, and thus may\npose a serious hazard to rescuers or health care personnel.  Simple water washing may be\ninsufficient  to  remove  oily  compounds.    Wash  only  contaminated  areas  with  soap  and/or\nshampoo,  if  possible.    Decontaminate  victim  thoroughly  before  handling  them  without  protective\nclothing.\nSUBJECT:      Ambulance Response to Hazardous Materials Spills                                            POLICY: 6200\n                                                                                                        DATE:  06/01/91\n\n        PREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT AFTER INITIAL DECONTAMINATION:\n\n                PESTICIDES – CARBAMATES AND ORGANOPHOSPHATES\n\n\nFORMS:       Liquid  (usually  in  solution  with  xylene  or  other  organic  solvent),  solid  (wettable\n             powder).

Locate the insertion site and Insert intraosseous needle. The proximal\n               humerus is the preferred insertion site for adult patients.\n\n               1.     Humeral-\n                      a.  Place the patient’s hand over the abdomen (elbow adducted and\n                           humerus internally rotated)\n                      b.   Place your palm on the patient’s shoulder anteriorly; the “ball”\n                           under your palm is the general target area\n                      c.

Place the ulnar aspect of your hand vertically over the axilla and the\n                           ulnar aspect of your other hand along the midline of the upper arm\n                           laterally\n                      e.  Place your thumbs together over the arm; this identifies the vertical\n                           line of insertion on the proximal humerus\n                      f.   Palpate deeply up the humerus to the surgical neck\n                      g.  This may feel like a golf ball on a tee – the spot where the “ball”\n                           meets the “tee” is the surgical neck\n                      h.  The insertion site is 1 to 2 cm above the surgical neck, on the most\n                           prominent aspect of the greater tubercle\n\n               2.     Tibia-\n                      a.  Aim the needle set at a 90-degree angle to the bone\n                      b.  Push the needle set tip through the skin until the tip rests against\n                           the bone\n                      c.  The 5 mm mark must be visible above the skin for confirmation of\n                           adequate needle set length\n                      d.  Gently drill, advancing the needle set approximately 1-2 cm after\n                           entry into the medullary space or until the needle set hub is close to\n                           the skin\n\n         F.    Flush or bolus the IO catheter rapidly with 10 mL of normal saline using a 10\n               mL syringe; for pediatrics use 2-5 mL normal saline.\n         G.    Confirm proper placement in marrow cavity as evidenced by:\n               1.     A decrease in resistance after needle passes through the bone cortex;\n               2.     The needle standing upright without support;\n               3.     The ability to aspirate bone marrow into syringe connected to the\n                      needle;\n               4.     Ability to push IV fluids through the IO needle without evidence of\n                      subcutaneous infiltration;\n         H.    Dress the site and secure the IO device in place;\n         I.      Lidocaine 2% administration for pain relief in conscious patients;\n               1.     Prepare Lidocaine 2% -40 mg for adults and 0.5 mg/kg for\n                      pediatrics(max dose of 40mg)\n               2.     Prime extension set with Lidocaine\n\n\n\n\nPolices & Procedures/Policy 6603                                                                                                 6603-3SUBJECT:  Intraosseous Cannulation                                                                                   Policy 6603\n                                                                                           December 28, 2015\n\n\n               3.     Note that the priming volume of the EZ-Connect® Extension Set is\n                      approximately 1.0 mL\n               4.      Slowly infuse lidocaine 40 mg IO over 120 seconds\n               5.      Allow Lidocaine to dwell in IO space 60 seconds\n         J.     Since there is relatively high pressure in the bone marrow cavity, fluids and\n               medications must be administered under pressure when given using an\n               intraosseous access device.  This requires the use of either a pressure bag\n               on the IV solution or the use of a syringe to inject fluids or medications\n               under pressure.\n         K.    Continuous monitoring of soft tissues surrounding insertion site is required\n               for early recognition of signs of infiltration.\n\n\nVII.     CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (CQI)\n         A.    Each agency’s CQI Coordinator will evaluate the use of the IO on all\n               patients (adult and pediatric) and report results at County CQI committee\n               meetings;\n         B.    Each Agency using the IO device for adults will provide initial training for all\n               paramedics to ensure competency in the procedure;\n         C.    To ensure skill competency each Advanced Life Support (ALS) Provider will\n               provide annual “skills” practical update training for adult and pediatric IO;\n         D.    Annual training records for adult and pediatric IO will be submitted to the\n               EMS Agency by the end of January each year for training accomplished the\n               preceding calendar year.\n\n\n                                                 / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolices & Procedures/Policy 6603                                                                                                 6603-4",

Expose shoulder, adduct humerus (place the patient’s arm against the\n       patient’s body) resting the elbow on the stretcher or ground, and have the\n       forearm resting on the abdomen.\n\n   2.  Palpate and identify the mid-shaft humerus and continue palpating toward\n       the proximal aspect or humeral head.  A small protrusion exists near the\n       shoulder; this is the base of the greater tubercle insertion site.  With the\n       opposite hand consider “pinching” the anterior and inferior aspects of the\n       humeral head while confirming the identification of the greater tubercle.\n       This will ensure that the midline of the humerus itself has been identified.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n   1.  Identify two land marks on the lateral shoulder consisting of the acromion\n       and the coracoid process.  This can be accomplished by placing one hand\n       on the lateral superior aspect of the patient’s shoulder and palpating for\n       the protrusions.  Identifying the coracoid process and the acromion can\n       also be accomplished by “walking” the index and middle fingers along the\n       clavicle to the shoulder’s lateral end.\n\n   2.  Identify the greater tubercle insertion site approximately two finger widths\n       inferior to the coracoid process and the acromion.  To envision the location\n       of this site, create a “T” - the upper portion of the letter connecting the\n       coracoid process and the acromion while the “leg” reaches inferiorly and\n       slightly anteriorly - approximately two finger widths along the midline\n       between the two structures.",

FIELD CARE\n         A.   Paramedics evaluate patients and provide treatment according to protocol.\n         B.   Paramedics (First Responder and/or Transport) will complete a 12 lead EKG as\n              soon as possible.\n         C.    If the 12 Lead EKG reading shows ***Suspected Acute MI***, or Solano County\n               authorized equivalent, the paramedic will follow Protocol C 14.\n         D.   For unstable patients, contact base hospital physician and consider transport to\n              closest facility.\n         E.   ALS Providers will notify the EMS Agency in writing within seven (7) days of\n              purchasing or updating 12-lead ECG software or a new 12 lead monitor.\n\nIII.     DESTINATION\n         A.   If field 12 Lead EKG shows ***Suspected Acute MI***, or Solano County authorized\n              equivalent, the paramedic will use protocol C14 to make a hospital destination\n              decision.\n               1. Patients in cardiac arrest with Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) will be\n                  transported to the nearest authorized SRC.\n         B.   Paramedics will leave the 12 Lead EKG electrodes in place on the patient’s chest\n              arms and legs so the hospital can quickly obtain their own 12 lead EKG.\n         C.   Based on geographic location the paramedic will transport patient to the designated\n              Solano County SRC that can be reached in the shortest length of time.\n         D.   The LEMSA will identify in and out-of-county STEMI Receiving Centers authorized\n              to receive transports from Solano County paramedics.\n\nIV.       PCI CENTERS/STEMI Receiving Centers (SRC)\n         A.   Any Hospital can become a PCI Center or STEMI Receiving Center providing they\n              participate in a national data registry and meet the following criteria:\n              1.  Complete Solano County EMS Agency’s SRC application and pay the\n                  appropriate annual fee of $10,000.00 (Ten Thousand dollars);\n              2.

Capnograph – an instrument used to produce a capnogram, a tracing that\n            shows the proportion of carbon dioxide in a volume of gas.\n        C.  Capnometry - Is the measurement of CO2 in a volume of gas.\n        D.  Capnometer - a device for monitoring the end-tidal partial pressure of carbon\n            dioxide. Generally using color change to indicate the presence of carbon\n            dioxide. This type of device is not as accurate as End Tidal CO2 monitoring for\n            endotracheal tube verification.\nII.     Training\n        Each Advanced Life Support (ALS) Provider shall provide paramedics training on\n        the use of ETCO2 Monitoring, including but not limited to, use, trouble shooting, and\n        waveform evaluation.\n        A.  Each ALS Provider shall provide training approved by the Agency’s Medical\n            Director and Solano County EMS Agency on ETCO2, based on the\n            manufacturer’s recommendations.\n        B.  Each paramedic must be trained in the use of ETCO2 before they are\n            authorized to use the device.\n\nIII.    Procedure\n\n        A.  Attach the End-Tidal CO2 detector to the Blind Insertion Airway Device (BIAD) or\n            the Endotracheal Tube (ET). Capnography is the preferred method of verifying\n            correct placement of the endotracheal tube.\n        B.  Note the CO2 level and waveform changes.  Levels and waveforms are to be\n            documented on the PCR.  A copy of all waveforms will be attached to PCRs..\n        C.  Capnography will remain in place and be monitored throughout the duration of\n            the call, or until the patient is transferred to a higher level of care.\n        D.  Any loss of CO2 detection or waveform will be documented.\n        E.  In all patients with a pulse an ETCO2  > 20 is anticipated.  In the post-\n            resuscitation patient no effort should be made to lower ETCO2 by modification of\n            the ventilator rate. In post-resuscitation patients without evidence of ongoing,\n            severe bronchospasm, the ventilator rate should never be < 6 breaths per\n            minute.\n        F.  Any significant movement, emesis, or change in clinical condition shall be\n            reassessed and documented in the PCR.  If at any time the capnography\n            indicates that the tube is not in the trachea the airway must be removed and the\n            patient re-intubated.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies & Procedures; Policy 6610                                                                      2 of 4SUBJECT:  End Tidal CO2 Monitoring                                                             POLICY:  6610\n                                                                          Implementation Date:  12/01/13\n                                                                                    Release Date:  10/14/13\n\n\n    IV.  Quality Improvement:\n             A.  The ALS Provider will audit the use of ETCO2 on a monthly basis to ensure\n                 the procedure is followed. This information will be reported during the\n                 quarterly PCC/CQI meeting.\n                      a.  This report will include, but not be limited to, the number of times  the\n                          ETCO2 was used, number of total calls, percentage of use, failures,\n                          etc.\n             B.  ALS Providers will provide an annual record of paramedics trained in the use\n                 of ETCO2 by February 28 of each year..\n\n\n    VI.    Documentation.\n             A.  Document ETCO2 numeric values and attach a copy of the waveform to the\n                 Patient Care Report (PCR).\n             B.  Capnography should be monitored in one minute intervals and each time the\n                 patient is moved.  All numeric values will be documented on the PCR.\n\n\n         A.

Orders for maintaining and adjusting           blood transfusion rate\n                          during transport.\n                 2.       Telephone number where the transferring physician can be reached\n                          during transport.\n        C.       Paramedic personnel must be knowledgeable in the operation of the\n                 specific blood delivery/warming device.\n        D.       Regulation of the transfusion rate will be within the parameters defined by\n                 the transferring physician.\n        E.       Verify the patient and blood with the sending RN by checking the patient\n                 ID band against the blood label(s) and blood order for name, blood                      type\n                 and unit identifying number.\n        F.

Monitor the patient for any signs and symptoms of a transf                  usion reaction.\n                 Monitor temperature for adverse effects if transport time exceeds 15\n                 minutes. The following are the most common types of transfusion\n                 reactions that may occur:\n                 1.       Hemolytic reactions: Hemolytic reactions are the most life               -\n                          threatening. Clinical manifestations may vary considerably: fever,\n                          headache, chest or back pain, pain            at infusion site, hypotension,\n                          nausea, generalized bleeding or oozing from surgical                site, shock. The\n                          most common cause is from ABO incompatibility due to                   a clerical\n                          error or transfusion to the wrong patient. Chances of survival are\n                          dose dependent therefore it is important to stop the transfusion\n                          immediately if a hemolytic reaction          is suspected. Give a fluid\n                          challenge.\n                 2.       Febrile non-hemolytic reaction: Chills and fever (rise from baseline\n                          temperature of 1°C or 1.8°F).

INITIAL EDAP DESIGNATION PROCESS:\n\n        A hospital must follow these instructions to initiate the process to obtain\n        recognition as an Emergency Department Approved for Pediatrics (EDAP).\n\n        A.    Application Instructions\n\n              1.   A hospital choosing to participate in the voluntary facility recognition\n                   process submits a letter of intent to the Solano County EMS Agency.\n              2.   Within two weeks, Solano County EMS personnel will review the letter of\n                   intent and send a letter of receipt outlining next steps.\n              3.   A formal application is required.  The EDAP Application Attachment A\n                   and EDAP Application Attachment B can be found at the Solano County\n                   EMS website under the forms tab.

Site Survey Team\n\n               1.  The site survey team will be comprised, at a minimum, of a physician\n                   and nurse team along with a representative(s) from the Solano EMS\n                   agency.  All team members will be given information regarding the site\n                   survey responsibilities, expectations, process, and assessment.\n\n        E.  Following the Site Survey\n\n               1.  Within six weeks following the site visit, the hospital will receive the\n                   results of the survey.  Hospitals meeting all requirements will receive a\n                   letter from the Solano EMS agency formally recognizing the hospital as\n                   EDAP certified.\n               2.  Hospitals that do not meet the requirements will receive a letter from the\n                   Solano EMS agency outlining the areas of non-compliance.  Any\n                   outstanding unmet criteria identified during the site visit must be\n                   addressed within six weeks. If deemed necessary, another site survey\n                   may be scheduled.\n               3.  Withdrawal of recognition status may occur at any time should a hospital\n                   fail to meet any of the requirements.  In this situation, the hospital will\n                   notify Solano County EMS at least 60 days prior to withdrawal and\n                   identify how area prehospital provider agencies, area hospitals, and\n                   Solano County EMS Agency will be notified.\n\nIX.     EDAP Renewal Process\n\n        A.       Renewal of EDAP designation will occur annually, with site visits\n                 scheduled as necessary.  Hospitals must submit the renewal\n                 application and fees along with supporting documentation.\n          B.     A letter will be sent to the hospitals notifying them of when Solano\n                 County EMS is accepting applications for renewal.  Applications should\n                 be submitted by the due date announced by the agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies & Procedures/Policy 7300                                                             7300-12\nSUBJECT:         Policy 7300                                                                   May 21, 2014\n                 EDAP- Specialty Center Designation\n\nX.      Destination Protocols for Ambulances:\n\n        In all cases, the health and well-being of the pediatric patient is the overriding\n        consideration in determining patient destination.  Factors to be considered\n        include severity and stability of the pediatric patient’s illness or injury; current\n        status of the pediatric receiving facility; anticipated transport time; and request by\n        the patient, family guardian, or physician.\n\n        For purposes of this policy, the closest receiving center is the most\n        accessible EDAP.\n\n        A.       Critically Injured Child/Minor:\n\n                  Paramedics will transport critically injured children/minors to the closest\n                   Pediatric Trauma Center.\n\n        B.       Critically Ill Child/Minor:\n\n                   Paramedics will transport critically ill children/minors to the closest\n                   EDAP.\n\n          C.     Non-Critical Child/Minor:\n\n                   All children/minors entering the EMS system who require ambulance\n                   transport, and are critically ill or injured, will be transported to the\n                   closest EDAP.  However, for children/minors who are NOT critically ill or\n                 injured, requests for transport to a Non-EDAP (or more distant EDAP) may\n                 be honored. Such requests will require signature by the patient’s legal\n                 guardian. Paramedics will ensure documentation of this request within the\n                 patient’s PCR and submit the Non-EDAP Acknowledgement Form to the\n                 EMS.\n\n                   If a parent or guardian is not present, the minor will be transported to the\n                 closest EDAP.\n\n         D.      Non-EDAP Transport Acknowledgement Form:\n\n                 1.       Paramedics will inform the parent or person legally responsible for\n                          the child that a form requesting transportation to an emergency\n                          department that has not been designated as an EDAP must be\n                          completed.\n                 2.       Original copies will be submitted by the transporting agency by\n                          the 15th of every month.\n\n*Note:  See Attachment G for a copy of the Non-EDAP Transport Acknowledgment\nForm.\n\n\nPolicies & Procedures/Policy 7300                                                               7300-13\nSUBJECT:         Policy 7300                                                                May 21, 2014\n                 EDAP- Specialty Center Designation\n\nXI.     Solano EMS Data Sharing and Meeting Participation Requirements\n\n        Attendance of PI/EDAP and Trauma Advisory Committee (TAC) meetings are\n        mandatory; and attendance of STEMI meetings is highly recommended.\n\n        Data sharing is an important aspect of process improvement and efficiency of\n        prehospital care.  Representatives from the EDAP designated hospitals will\n        present the following information at the EMS Quarterly meetings:\n\n        1.     Data on system performance for each EDAP hospital.  The content of the\n               presentation should be focused on identifying opportunities for improvement\n               and to recognize outstanding performance given by prehospital personnel.\n               The presentation should include patient interfacility transfers, and patient\n               outcome.\n        2.     Cases that involve the three required pediatric process improvement\n               monitors:\n                 a.  Pediatric Deaths\n                 b.  Pediatric Interfacility Transfers\n                 c.  Suspected child/minor abuse/neglect\n        3.     Cases that did not follow Policy 7300\n\nALS field providers must comply with all policies and protocols used to care for pediatric\npatients.

Approximately 30 million children are seen each\nyear in our nation’s emergency departments (ED’s).  Most of these children\n(90%) will arrive by private car and 10% will arrive by ambulance.  Each ED must\nbe prepared with appropriate staff, equipment, supplies, and procedures to\nprovide quality care regardless of the patient’s age or presenting complaint.\n\nThese processes will ensure that all trauma centers and designated emergency\ndepartments that receive pediatric patients through the 9-1-1 system have the\nappropriately trained staff and the necessary equipment to provide quality care\nfor those pediatric patients.\n\nThe Solano County EDAP standards meet or exceed the standards established\nby the Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) administration,\npersonnel, and policy guidelines for the care of pediatric patients in the\nemergency department set forth by the California Emergency Services Authority\nin 1995. These guidelines are specifically designed to provide ED’s with the\nnecessary resources for the care of children in the emergency setting.\n\nWithout a pediatric critical care center or Children’s hospital, Solano County has\nfew to little resources to offer pediatric disaster victims.  The EDAP process by\ndesign will ensure rigorous standards are set, adhered to, regulated and\nsustained in order to address factors such as pediatric emergency readiness,\npediatric disaster preparedness, and acute care and appropriate transfer of the\npediatric patient.\n\nIn addition to being a resource document explaining and detailing the EDAP\nprocess the application at the end of this manual will serve as request and\nguideline for designation by the Solano County EMS Agency as an EDAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                 1",

OXYGEN THERAPY – Begin oxygen at 6 liters/minute by nasal cannula or 10 liters/minute by\n          mask.  If there is a history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), observe for\n          respiratory depression and support respiration as needed.  DO NOT withhold oxygen from a\n          patient in cardiorespiratory distress because of a history of COPD;\n2.          Reassure the patient and place in a position of comfort;\n3.          Loosen tight clothing;\n4.          Restrict patient movement, lift patient onto stretcher;\n5.          If the patient wants to take their own medication allow them to do so;\nSPECIAL NOTE:\nIf the patient wants to take their own nitroglycerine, allow the patient to do so.

It is recommended that a patient\nwith a blood pressure less than 110mmgHg be advised not to take medication because of the risks\nassociated with hypotension.  Blood pressure, pulse and respirations must be checked each time a patient\ntakes their own medication.  If the blood pressure drops dramatically, or the patient exhibits a decreased\nlevel of consciousness, lay the patient down and elevate legs.

Treatment\n               during this process shall be confined to opening the airway and controlling serious\n               hemorrhage;\n          b.   Based on the primary Survey findings, prioritize casualties:\n               Ø  IMMEDIATE (RED):  These patients are of the highest priority and are removed and\n                      treated first.  They are the ones that will die within an hour if not treated rapidly.  These\n                      patients may have altered levels of consciousness, respirations less than 8/minor,\n                      greater than 36/min and/or delayed capillary refill.\n               Ø     DELAYED (YELLOW):                      The patients falling into this category are those whose\n                      injuries are such that they will produce death after an hour, if not treated.  These\n                      injuries are serious and need attention, however, treatment and removal may be delayed\n                      until the Priority 1 patients have been stabilized.  Examples may include burns, major\n                      multiple fractures and spinal injuries;\n               Ø  WALKING WOUNDED (GREEN)                     :  The types of injuries in this category may have\n                      treatment delayed and are generally transported by some means other than ambulance.\n                      Examples may include minor fractures, lacerations with minimal blood loss, rib\n                      fractures without breathing difficulty and minor burns.\n               Ø  D.O.A./NON-RESUSCITATABLE (BLACK):   These patients are already dead or so\n                      severely injured that death is certain within a short time, regardless of treatment given.\n          c.   Tag Patients according to priority and, if needed, gather into treatment areas by priority.\n3.          TREATMENT\n          a.   Begin treatment of casualties, immediate priority first, delayed second and so on, in\n               accordance with specific treatment guidelines.\n4.          ADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n          a.   As the needs for additional manpower and equipment become evident, those needs should be\n               communicated to the Incident Commander;\n          b.   Local hospitals should be notified as to the nature and extent of the disaster.\n                                                        1  of 2Disaster\n                                          D-01 Mass Casualty Incident                                         Revised 3/1/2000\n5.          TRANSPORT\n          a.   The most critically ill first, and others as indicated by severity, available equipment and\n               manpower allow.\n6.          RE-ASSESSMENT OF REMAINING PATIENTS\n          a.   As patients are triaged, treated and transported, re-                                                                               assessment of those w ho remain is carried\n               out.

Reassure mother, instruct during delivery;\n     5.   Drape patient, prepare delivery kit, wash hands and put on globes;\n     6.   Prevent explosive delivery of head by directing mother’s respirations and slight counter pressure\n          on the baby’s head;\n     7.   When the head is delivered, check neck for umbilical cord and if present, remove it from around\n          the neck.  If the cord cannot be removed, clamp in two places and cut between the two clamps.\n          Exercise extreme caution, blunt end scissors recommended for cutting cord;\n     8.   Suction nose and mouth of the infant until airway is clear;\n     9.   Ease delivery of upper and lower shoulder by gentle directional traction;\n     10. Lay baby at or below level of mother until cord is clamped.  Suction airway and dry infant.  Keep\n          the baby warm; be sure to wrap the head.  Double clamp the cord 8 – 10 inches from the infant\n          and cut cord.  Check carefully for bleeding.  If bleeding occurs, re-                                                                                                         clamp or tie cord closer to\n          infant;\n     11. Placenta may deliver prior to transport.  Do not pull on the cord.  Place placenta in a plastic bag\n          and retain;\n     12. Observe mother and infant frequently for complications.  Fundal massage and/or allowing the\n          child to nurse will cause the uterus to contract and decrease post-partum bleeding.  Prepare\n          mother and infant for transport.

Pack gauze tightly into the wound and directly onto the source of bleeding. More\n           than one gauze may be needed.\n      b.  Use one gloved hand to feed gauze and the other to maintain pressure and hold\n           the gauze in place.\n      c.  Use gloved fingers to maintain pressure and hold gauze. Proper technique will\n           allow for continuous pressure.\n      d.  Be cautious of sharp fracture edges and foreign bodies when packing wounds.\n      e.  Apply and hold direct, firm pressure, for 3-5mins.\n3.   Apply a pressure dressing to prov        ide ongoing pressure and secure the\n      wound packing in place.\n\n      Any hemostatic gauze is approved for use by EMS under this criteria:\n      1. The active hemostatic agent must be incorporated into the gauze (loose\n      granules or granules delivered in an applicator, or particles sprinkled into the\n      wound, are not authorized).\n      2.
