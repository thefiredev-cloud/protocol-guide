-- ORPHANED RECORD DETECTION
-- =============================================================================
-- This migration helps identify records that would violate foreign key constraints
-- Run these queries and fix data BEFORE proceeding to add foreign keys

-- =============================================================================
-- DUPLICATE DETECTION (for unique constraints)
-- =============================================================================

-- Check for duplicate user auth providers

  SELECT userId, provider, COUNT(*) as cnt
  FROM user_auth_providers
  GROUP BY userId, provider
  HAVING cnt > 1
) duplicates;

-- Check for duplicate agency members

FROM (
  SELECT agencyId, userId, COUNT(*) as cnt
  FROM agency_members
  GROUP BY agencyId, userId
  HAVING cnt > 1
) duplicates;

-- Check for duplicate stripe webhook events
SELECT 'Duplicate stripe events' as issue_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM (
  SELECT eventId, COUNT(*) as cnt
  FROM stripe_webhook_events
  GROUP BY eventId
  HAVING cnt > 1
) duplicates;

-- =============================================================================
-- CLEANUP SUGGESTIONS
-- =============================================================================
-- If orphaned records are found, you can clean them up with commands like:
--
-- DELETE FROM bookmarks WHERE userId NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users);
-- DELETE FROM queries WHERE countyId NOT IN (SELECT id FROM counties);
-- etc.
--
-- OR set them to NULL if the column is nullable:
-- UPDATE feedback SET countyId = NULL WHERE countyId NOT IN (SELECT id FROM counties);
