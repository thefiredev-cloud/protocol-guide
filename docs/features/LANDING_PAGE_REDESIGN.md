# Landing Page Redesign - Firefighter Focus

## Current Problem
Landing page may read too "tech startup" - need to speak to firefighters, not developers.

## Target Audience
- LA County firefighter/paramedics
- Blue collar, practical, skeptical of tech hype
- Technical in EMS sense (medications, protocols, procedures)
- NOT technical in developer sense (no jargon)

## Messaging Principles

### DO
- "Get the right dose in seconds"
- "Protocol lookup faster than flipping the binder"
- "Built by firefighters, for firefighters"
- "Works offline, works at 3 AM"
- Show the ambulance, the rig, the real environment
- Use their language: "on scene", "in the back", "during transport"

### DON'T
- "AI-powered" (say "smart search" if anything)
- "Seamless integration" (say "works with ImageTrend")
- "Leverage" "optimize" "streamline" (corp-speak)
- Stock photos of people in pristine scrubs
- Feature lists that sound like a SaaS product page

## Hero Section
**Headline:** "The protocol you need. Now."
**Subhead:** "LA County protocols at your fingertips. Search, find, treat."
**CTA:** "Try it now" (goes straight to search, no signup)

## Social Proof
- "Used by X LA County crews" (once we have numbers)
- Medical Director endorsement (if available)
- "Built with input from LACoFD paramedics"

## Feature Blocks (reframed)

### Pediatric Dosing
- Old: "Weight-based medication calculator with safety checks"
- New: "Stop doing math on peds calls. Enter weight, get the dose in mL."

### Protocol Search  
- Old: "Semantic search across all protocols"
- New: "Type what you're looking for. Get the answer."

### Offline Mode
- Old: "Progressive Web App with offline capability"
- New: "Works without cell signal. Every time."

### ImageTrend Integration
- Old: "Deep linking from ePCR documentation"
- New: "One tap from ImageTrend to the protocol you need."

## Visual Style
- Dark mode default (night calls are real)
- Photos of actual rigs, actual scenes (with permission)
- LA County colors/branding subtle nod
- Mobile-first (this is used on phones, not desktops)

## Trust Elements
- HIPAA compliant (small badge, not headline)
- No patient data stored
- "Protocol content from official LA County sources"
- Medical Director reviewed (if applicable)

## CTA Strategy
- Primary: Go straight to search (no friction)
- Secondary: "Add to home screen" prompt for PWA
- No email capture on first visit - prove value first
