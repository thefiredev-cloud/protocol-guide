# Feature: ECMO Transport Protocol

## Problem
- ECMO protocol is literally taped inside the squad compartment
- Ultra-rare call type, ultra-high stakes
- Nobody has this memorized
- Perfect LFHR (Low Frequency, High Risk) use case

## User Story
As a firefighter transporting an ECMO patient, I need the monitoring parameters and troubleshooting steps because I've never done this before and the protocol is on a crinkled paper.

## Current State
- **NOT INDEXED** - need to obtain the ECMO protocol PDF
- May be LACoFD-specific, not LEMSA-wide

## Content Needed
- ECMO patient assessment
- Monitoring parameters (flows, pressures, alarms)
- Troubleshooting (air in circuit, low flow, power issues)
- Transport considerations
- Contact numbers for ECMO team

## UI Requirements
- Quick reference card format
- Alarm troubleshooting as decision tree
- Emergency contacts prominent
- Offline mandatory - can't rely on cell signal

## Action Required
1. Obtain ECMO protocol PDF from LACoFD or county
2. Index and chunk the content
3. Create dedicated ECMO quick-reference view

## Demo Angle
"That protocol taped in your compartment? Now it's searchable, always up to date, and you can pull it up in 2 seconds."
