# Protocol Guide - App Store Optimization Strategy

**Date**: January 22, 2026
**Key Value Prop**: 2-second protocol retrieval vs 90-second manual search
**Target Audience**: EMS professionals (Paramedics, EMTs, Fire personnel)

---

## Executive Summary

Protocol Guide's core competitive advantage is **speed**: retrieving protocols in 2 seconds vs the industry average of 90+ seconds with manual PDF searching. This 45x speed improvement should be the centerpiece of all ASO efforts.

## 5. Competitive Positioning

### Direct Competitors

| App | Weakness | Our Advantage |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| **Medscape** | Generic medical, not EMS-specific | EMS-only focus, county protocols |
| **Epocrates** | Drug-focused, not protocol-focused | Full protocol workflows |
| **UpToDate** | Expensive ($500+/yr), hospital-focused | Affordable ($49/yr), field-focused |
| **Field Guide apps** | Static PDFs, no search | AI semantic search |
| **State protocol PDFs** | Manual navigation, no voice | Voice input, instant search |

### Differentiation Messaging

**Speed**: "2 seconds vs 90 seconds"
**AI**: "Understands 'epi for allergic reaction' = Epinephrine, Anaphylaxis protocol"
**Voice**: "Only EMS protocol app with hands-free voice input"
**Offline**: "Downloaded protocols work in tunnels, elevators, rural areas"
**Coverage**: "55,000+ protocols from 2,738 agencies across all 50 states"

---

## 6. Review Generation Strategy

### In-App Review Prompts

**Trigger Conditions** (only prompt after positive experience):
1. User completes 10+ successful protocol searches
2. User uses voice input successfully 3+ times
3. User bookmarks 5+ protocols
4. User upgrades to Pro

**Prompt Timing**:
- After successful query with <2s response time
- Show satisfaction check first: "Was this answer helpful?"
- Only show App Store prompt if user taps "Yes"
