Worked perfectly the first time.

Can't wait to show you all.

No typing. No scrolling. Just ask.

(3/6) Why we built this:

A medic told us: "I can't type with gloves on in the back of a rig."

That stuck with us. So we built this.

(4/6) How to use it:

1. Tap the microphone icon
2. Say your query naturally
3. Get instant results

That's it.

(5/6) Works best for:

- On-scene quick lookups

## Crisis Communications

### When to Pause Content

- Major national tragedies
- Large-scale EMS incidents in the news
- Death of prominent EMS figure
- Natural disasters affecting EMS

### Crisis Protocol

1. **Immediately**: Pause all scheduled promotional content
2. **Assess**: Determine appropriate response level
3. **If applicable**, post supportive message:
```
Our hearts are with the EMS community during this difficult time.

[Brief acknowledgment of situation if appropriate]

We're here if you need us.
```
4. **Wait**: Resume normal content when appropriate (typically 24-72 hours)

### Issues Involving Protocol Guide

If Protocol Guide is mentioned in connection with a patient care issue:

1. **Do not respond publicly** without leadership approval
2. **Draft response** and get legal review if needed
3. **Standard response if needed**:
```
Protocol Guide is a reference tool and does not replace clinical judgment, training, or medical direction.

We take these matters seriously. Please contact us directly at [email].
