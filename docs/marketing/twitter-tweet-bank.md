## Launch Week Tweets

### Day 1: Launch Announcement

**Thread (Pin This)**
```
(1/5) Introducing Protocol Guide - the modern way to find EMS protocols.

We built the app we wished we had on the rig.

Here's what it does

(2/5) Type a question like you'd ask a colleague:

"Pediatric cardiac arrest dosing"
"SVT algorithm"
"Anaphylaxis epinephrine"

Get the protocol you need in <3 seconds.

[ATTACH: Screenshot of search]

(3/5) The numbers:

55,000+ protocol sections indexed
2,700+ EMS agencies covered
All 50 states + DC + territories
Works offline when signal fails

(4/5) Why we built this:

Flipping through 300-page PDF binders while running a code isn't working.

Protocol Guide puts what you need at your fingertips when seconds count.

(5/5) Try it free:

Basic search is free forever.
Pro unlocks advanced AI search + full offline access for $4.99/mo.

Download: protocol-guide.com

### Day 2: How It Works

```
How Protocol Guide search works:

1. Type your question naturally
2. AI finds the most relevant protocol
3. Get a concise answer with the source

No memorizing codes. No endless scrolling.

Just ask and get what you need.

#EMS
```

### Day 3: Coverage Highlight

```
Protocol Guide now covers 2,700+ agencies across all 50 states.

Check if your agency's protocols are included:

Don't see yours? Let us know - we're adding more every week.
```

### Day 4: Offline Feature

```
No signal in that basement?

Protocol Guide works offline.

Your most-used protocols are always available, even when cellular isn't.

Because the middle of a call isn't the time to troubleshoot connectivity.

#EMS
```

### Day 5: Voice Search

```
Can't type with gloves on?

Protocol Guide has voice search.

Just say what you need. Get the answer.

Built for the realities of EMS.

## Educational Content Tweets

### Protocol Tips

```
Quick reminder: Epinephrine for Anaphylaxis

Adult IM: 0.3-0.5 mg (1:1,000)
Pediatric IM: 0.01 mg/kg (max 0.3 mg)

Anterolateral thigh is the preferred site.

Always follow your local protocols.

#EMSEducation
```

```
Stroke assessment beyond Cincinnati:

LAMS (Los Angeles Motor Scale) can help identify LVO strokes in the field.

Face droop: 1 point
Arm drift: 1 point
Grip strength: 2 points

4+ suggests LVO - consider comprehensive stroke center.

#EMSEducation
```

```
Pain management tip:

Document your pain assessment BEFORE and AFTER treatment.

It takes 30 seconds and makes your care look as good on paper as it is in practice.

#EMS
```

```
Pediatric vital signs vary by age.

Don't remember the ranges? That's what Protocol Guide is for.

Type "peds vitals 3 year old" and get the reference instantly.

12-lead placement reminder:

V1: 4th intercostal, right sternal border
V2: 4th intercostal, left sternal border
V3: Between V2 and V4
V4: 5th intercostal, midclavicular
V5: Same level as V4, anterior axillary
V6: Same level as V4, midaxillary

#EMSEducation
```

### Clinical Pearls

```
Clinical pearl: RSI prep

Have your backup plan ready before you push the drugs.

Bougie loaded. BVM ready. Cric kit open.

Hope for the best. Plan for the worst.
```

```
The best medics I know all do one thing:

They tell the patient what they're doing before they do it.

Builds trust. Reduces anxiety. Makes your job easier.

Simple but powerful.
```

```
When your patient says "I feel like I'm going to die"

Listen. That sense of impending doom is real and often accurate.

Trust your patient. They know their body.
```

### Quick Facts

```
Did you know?

The first ambulance service in the US was established in Cincinnati in 1865.

We've come a long way from horse-drawn wagons.

#EMSHistory
```

```
EMS by the numbers:

- 240+ million 911 calls per year in the US
- 800,000+ EMS professionals
- 21,000+ EMS agencies

You're part of something big.
