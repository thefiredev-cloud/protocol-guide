# Searching for Protocols

Master the art of finding the exact protocol you need in seconds.

## How Search Works

Protocol Guide uses **AI-powered semantic search** to understand your questions and find relevant protocols. Unlike keyword-based search, you can ask questions naturally – just like you'd ask a colleague.

### The Technology Behind It

1. **Your question** is converted into a numerical representation (embedding)
2. **55,000+ protocol chunks** are searched for semantic similarity
3. **AI (Claude)** reads the most relevant protocols
4. **A tailored response** is generated addressing your specific question

## Search Tips

### Be Specific

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Cardiac" | "Adult cardiac arrest treatment protocol" |
| "Drugs" | "Epinephrine dosing for anaphylaxis" |
| "Breathing" | "Management of respiratory distress in pediatric patients" |

### Include Patient Context

The AI provides better answers when you include:

- **Age group**: Adult, pediatric, geriatric, neonate
- **Condition**: Specific symptoms or diagnosis
- **Setting**: Field, ambulance, interfacility transport

**Examples**:
- "Pediatric seizure protocol for 5-year-old"
- "Geriatric fall assessment guidelines"
- "Neonatal resuscitation in the field"

### Ask Follow-Up Questions

Protocol Guide maintains conversation context. You can ask:

1. "What's the dose of adenosine for SVT?"
2. "What if the patient is pediatric?"
3. "What are the contraindications?"

Each follow-up refines the response based on previous context.
