## The AI Summary

### What It Contains

The AI summary is the primary answer to your question. It includes:

- **Direct Answer**: Specific response to your query
- **Dosages**: Medication doses with routes and frequencies
- **Steps**: Numbered treatment steps when applicable
- **Considerations**: Special circumstances, contraindications, precautions
- **Age/Weight Adjustments**: Pediatric or weight-based modifications

### Example Summary

**Query**: "What's the dose of epinephrine for anaphylaxis?"

**AI Summary**:
> For **anaphylaxis** in adults:
> 
> **Epinephrine 1:1,000 (1mg/mL)**
> - **Dose**: 0.3-0.5mg IM (anterolateral thigh preferred)
> - **May repeat**: Every 5-15 minutes as needed
> 
> **Pediatric**: 0.01mg/kg IM (max 0.3mg)
> 
> **If no response after 2-3 IM doses**, consider:
> - Epinephrine 1:10,000 IV push: 0.1mg slow IV
> - Epinephrine drip if available
> 
> ⚠️ **Caution**: Use with care in elderly patients and those with cardiac conditions

### How to Use This Information

1. **Verify** the information matches your local protocols
2. **Confirm** patient specifics (age, weight, allergies)
3. **Cross-reference** with source protocols if unsure
4. **Document** the protocol used in your PCR

## Source Protocols

### What They Are

Source protocols are the **original documents** that the AI used to generate its response. These are actual EMS protocols from state/county medical directors.

### Why They Matter

- **Verification**: Confirm the AI's interpretation is correct
- **Complete Context**: See the full protocol, not just the excerpt
- **Legal Coverage**: Know exactly which approved protocol you're following
- **Learning**: Read surrounding information for better understanding

### Viewing Source Protocols

1. **Tap** on any source protocol to expand
2. **Read** the relevant section (highlighted)
3. **Scroll** to see the full protocol context
4. **Tap again** to collapse

### Source Information Shown

- **Protocol Title**: Official name of the protocol
- **Issuing Agency**: State, county, or regional authority
- **Last Updated**: When the protocol was last revised
- **Relevance Score**: How closely it matches your query (shown as a bar)
