## Why Voice Search?

In emergency situations, your hands are often occupied. Voice search lets you:

- 🧤 **Keep gloves on** – No need to remove PPE to type
- 🚑 **Stay focused on the patient** – Eyes up, not on a screen
- ⏱️ **Save critical seconds** – Speak faster than you type
- 🎯 **Natural queries** – Ask like you'd ask a partner

---

## How to Use Voice Search

### Starting Voice Search

1. **Tap the microphone icon** (🎤) in the search bar
2. **Wait for the listening indicator** (pulsing circle)
3. **Speak your question clearly**
4. **Wait for transcription** – Your words appear as text
5. **Review and search** – Results appear automatically

### Quick Voice Activation

On most devices, you can also:
- **Long-press** the search bar to activate voice
- Use your device's voice assistant: "Hey Siri, open Protocol Guide"

## Tips for Better Voice Recognition

### Speak Clearly

- Use a **normal speaking pace** – not too fast, not too slow
- **Pronounce medical terms** carefully
- **Minimize background noise** when possible
- **Hold the device** 6-12 inches from your mouth

### Handling Noisy Environments

Ambulance sirens, radio chatter, and scene noise can interfere. Try:

1. **Cup your hand** around the microphone
2. **Step away** from noise sources if safe
3. **Speak louder** than normal conversation
4. **Use short, clear phrases**

### Medical Terminology

The voice recognition is trained on medical terms. It understands:

- Drug names: "Epinephrine," "Adenosine," "Amiodarone"
- Conditions: "STEMI," "CVA," "Anaphylaxis"
- Abbreviations: "SVT," "VF," "AMS," "SOB"
- Procedures: "Intubation," "Cardioversion," "IO access"

Before your shift:
1. Test voice search works
2. Set your preferred region
3. Enable offline protocols

### During a Call

1. **Activate voice search** as you approach the patient
2. **Ask your question** while assessing
3. **Listen to/glance at results** 
4. **Treat the patient** with protocol guidance

### Partner Communication
