# Offline Usage Guide

Access critical protocols even without internet connectivity.

---

## Why Offline Access Matters

EMS calls happen everywhere – including places with poor or no cell signal:

- 🏔️ **Rural areas** with limited tower coverage
- 🏢 **Building interiors** where signal doesn't penetrate
- 🚇 **Underground** locations like subways and parking garages
- 📡 **Network outages** during disasters or high-usage events
- 🚁 **In-flight** during air medical transport

Protocol Guide's offline mode ensures you always have access to essential protocols.

---

## How Offline Mode Works

Protocol Guide uses **service worker technology** to cache protocols on your device:

1. **Automatic Caching**: Critical protocols download in the background
2. **Smart Updates**: New versions sync when you're online
3. **Offline Detection**: App automatically switches to offline mode
4. **Full Functionality**: Search, view, and access bookmarked protocols

---

## Setting Up Offline Access

### Enable Offline Mode

1. Go to **Profile** → **Settings** → **Offline Mode**
2. Toggle **"Enable Offline Protocols"** to ON
3. Select which protocols to download:
   - **Essential Only** (~50MB) – Critical emergency protocols
   - **My Region** (~150MB) – All protocols for your selected county
   - **Full Database** (~500MB) – All 55,000+ protocols (Pro only)
4. Tap **"Download Now"**
5. Keep the app open until download completes

### Storage Requirements

| Download Option | Size | Contents |
|-----------------|------|----------|
| Essential Only | ~50MB | Cardiac arrest, trauma, airway, common medications |
| My Region | ~150MB | All protocols for your county/state |
| Full Database | ~500MB | Complete national protocol database |

### Recommended: Download Over Wi-Fi

Large protocol downloads should be done on Wi-Fi to:
- Save cellular data
- Download faster
- Prevent interruptions

- **Dose Calculator**: Weight-based calculations
- **Quick Actions**: Common emergency protocols

### ❌ Requires Internet

### 2. Use the Dose Calculator

The built-in dose calculator works completely offline:

1. Go to **Tools** → **Dose Calculator**
2. Enter patient weight
3. Get instant weight-based calculations

### 3. Save Important Searches

Your search history is cached. View recent searches:

1. Tap the **clock icon** (🕐) in search bar
