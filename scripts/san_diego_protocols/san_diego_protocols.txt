                                                PREHOSPITAL TREATMENT – 100.1

    Principle
      • The objective of prehospital treatment is to provide timely, equitable, high-quality, and patient-centered care.

    Standards
      • All treatments shall be administered per protocol unless the patient declines, there is a contraindication, such as an
        allergy, or a Base Hospital Physician Order to withhold a required treatment.
      • When clinically indicated, more than one protocol may be applied for patient treatment.
      • All protocol treatments may be performed by the Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), Advanced Emergency
        Medical Technician (AEMT), and/or Paramedic via standing orders except for those stating Base Hospital Order
        (BHO) or Base Hospital Physician Order (BHPO). Standing orders may be continued after Base Hospital contact
        unless the Base Hospital directs otherwise.
      • Mobile Intensive Care Nurses (MICNs) may relay BHPOs.
      • These protocol standards do not apply when a physician on scene assumes responsibility for patient care (see S-
        403 Physician on Scene).
      • Base Hospital Physician 1 consultation is encouraged for unclear or complex situations.

         Base Hospital Physicians are authorized to:
            • Order additional doses or boluses of a protocolized treatment
            • Order the withholding of a protocolized treatment

         Base Hospital Physicians are not authorized to:
            • Order medications, routes, or procedures that are outside EMT, AEMT, or Paramedic scopes of practice 2
            • Modify Local Optional Scope of Practice (LOSOP) protocols
            • Order treatments specifically prohibited by local CoSD EMS protocols

         Under extraordinary circumstances, Base Hospital Physicians may order an Emergency Protocol
         Exception (EPE) when the following conditions are met:
            • Immediate/imminent risk of serious morbidity or mortality
            • S-104 or P-115 do not explicitly prohibit use 3
            • Complies with the above criteria for non-authorized orders

         The Base Hospital shall report every EPE to CoSD EMS as an “unusual event” within 24 hours




1
  Refer to S-403 Physician on Scene when a physician on scene assumes patient care
2
  EMS clinicians are only permitted to follow orders within their respective local scopes of practice (B-450, B-451, P-401)
3
  Per P-115, EPEs are not authorized for administration of ketamine in dissociative doses or naloxone in cardiac arrest

    N- Neurologic exam- Are there any abnormal sensory or motor findings?
    Weakness/numbness or complaints of paresthesia? Look for focal deficit, such as
    tingling, reduced strength, numbness in an extremity.

    S-Sixty five- Greater than or equal to 65 years of age?

    A- Altered- Is the patient oriented to person, place, time and situation? Is the patient
    altered in any way? Is there a language barrier? Is the patient cooperative?

    I-Intoxication- Is there any indication that the person is impaired by drugs or alcohol?

    D-Distracting injury- Is there any other injury which is capable of producing significant
    pain in this patient?

    S-Spine exam- Does the patient complain of neck or back pain? Assess entire spine for
    point tenderness or spinal process tenderness.




                                SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Prehospital provider assessment will determine what method is needed. Every patient with trauma
must receive an assessment. If any assessment component is positive, the patient requires spinal motion
restriction.

Patients with severe kyphosis or other anatomical or medical conditions (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis or
rheumatoid arthritis) may be stabilized using a combination of pillow, blanket, or other devices.

Spinal motion restriction should be accomplished using the most appropriate tool for the specific
circumstance. May include, but are not limited to, vacuum splints, pneumatic splints, cervical collars,
soft collars, straps, tape, as well as soft materials, such as pillows and blanket to minimize movement,
compression, or distraction of the spine.

Patients with acute or chronic difficulty breathing: Use spinal motion restriction with caution in
patients presenting with dyspnea and place patient in position best suited to protect the airway.

Classification
  • Antidysrhythmic

Mechanism of Action
 • Slows conduction through the AV node and interrupts AV reentry pathways as well as conduction through the SA
   nodes.

 Indications                                                 Contraindications
   • Management of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)         • Second- or third-degree AV block (without
   • Protocols: S-127, S-163                                    pacemaker)
                                                              • Sick sinus syndrome


 Adult Dose                                                  Pediatric Dose
  • Adenosine 6 mg rapid IV/IO followed by 20 mL NS            • Adenosine per drug chart rapid IV/IO, followed with
    rapid IV/IO                                                  20 mL NS rapid IV/IO, MR x2
  • If no conversion, adenosine 12 mg rapid IV/IO
    followed by 20 mL NS rapid IV/IO, MR x1

Adverse Effects
 • Flushing                      •   Hypotension
 • Sweating                      •   Feeling of impending doom
 • Dizziness                     •   Severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma
 • Nervousness                   •   Paresthesia

Notes
 • For stable patients, use Valsalva maneuver prior to administration. Discontinue Valsalva maneuver after 5-10
   seconds if no conversion.
 • Ideally, cannulate a proximal vein with an 18-20g catheter. Use the IV port closest to the patient and rapidly flush
   with 20mL normal saline immediately.
 • Run a 6-second ECG strip before, during, and after drug administration.
 • Patients frequently have a brief period of escape beats or asystole before the sinus node starts up again. This may
   be perceived as a feeling of impending death and can be extremely frightening for patients.
 • If the wide-complex tachycardia is ventricular in origin, adenosine is highly unlikely to result in cardioversion.
 • Bronchospasm may occur in patients with a history of airway disease, such as asthma or COPD.

Classification
  • Beta-2 receptor agonist

Mechanism of Action
 • Albuterol: Selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist that causes relaxation of smooth muscles in the bronchial tree,
   decreasing airway resistance, facilitating mucous drainage and increasing vital capacity; shifts potassium
   intracellular; has mild beta-1 activity that may increase heart rate.
 • Levalbuterol: Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle by action on beta-2 receptors; less likely to cause tachycardia than
   albuterol.

 Indications                                                 Contraindications
   • Management of respiratory distress (non-cardiac,         • <6 years of age (levalbuterol only)
     anaphylaxis, and burns), suspected hyperkalemia,
     and specific crush injuries
   • Protocols: S-122, S-124, S-127, S-131, S-136,

Notes
 • May omit atropine in bradycardic patients unlikely to have clinical benefit (e.g., heart transplant patients, second-
   degree type II, or third-degree heart block).
 • Use cautiously if myocardial infarction or ischemia is suspected, as atropine will increase myocardial oxygen
   demand, which may worsen the infarct.
 • In organophosphate poisoning, titrate atropine to SLUDGE/BBB signs/symptoms, not to tachycardia. Cardiac
   monitoring should be considered in all cases of severe organophosphate poisoning.

Classification
  • Alpha/beta adrenergic agonist

Mechanism of Action
 • A naturally occurring catecholamine that acts directly on alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. It is the most potent
   activator of alpha receptors, vasoconstricting the aorta and peripheral vasculature. Beta-1 stimulation increases
   inotropy, chronotropy, and AV conduction. Beta-2 stimulation causes bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and
   vasodilation to internal organs and skeletal muscles.

 Indications                                                 Contraindications

Notes
 • EMT: Authorized to administer via auto-injector only.
 • Epinephrine is the most important immediate treatment for anaphylaxis and should be administered as soon as
   anaphylaxis is recognized. The pharmacologic actions address the pathophysiologic changes that occur in
   anaphylaxis better than any other medication. Delayed epinephrine injection is associated with fatalities.
 • Inadvertent IV injection of usual IM formulation and dose constitutes a 10-fold overdose that can result in sudden
   and severe hypertension and cerebral hemorrhage.
 • In patients who remain hypotensive after initial IM epinephrine, administer IV fluids. Have push-dose epinephrine
   ready for patients unresponsive to repeated IM epinephrine and IV fluids.

Adverse Effects
 • Confusion                        • Respiratory depression             • Syncope
 • Paradoxical excitation           • Apnea                              • Nausea/vomiting
 • Delirium                         • Dyspnea                            • Abdominal pain
 • Sedation/drowsiness              • Dysrhythmias
 • CNS depression                   • Hypotension

Notes
 • Remember to consider non-pharmacologic pain treatments, e.g., place in position of comfort, apply ice packs/splints
   PRN, and verbal reassurance.
 • Closely monitor respiratory status (including capnography) after administration.
 • An initial dose of 100 mcg IV or 50 mcg IN is well tolerated in most adults.
 • In opioid-naive or elderly patients, start with a lower dose. For elderly patients not taking opioids, 25 mcg is
   frequently sufficient for pain relief. Consider beginning with 25 mcg and titrating up in increments of 25 mcg to
   achieve pain relief without respiratory depression.
 • For pediatric patients >36 kg or longer than the LBRT, rather than administering the maximum dose, use weight-
   based dosing for both initial and repeat doses. It is acceptable to round doses (up or down) to the nearest 5 mcg.

Classification
  • Nitrate, anti-anginal

Mechanism of Action
 • Nitrate enters vascular smooth muscle and is converted to nitric oxide leading to vasodilation. Relaxes smooth
   muscle via dose-dependent dilation of arterial and venous beds: reduces both preload, afterload, and myocardial
   oxygen demand. Also improves coronary collateral circulation. Lowers blood pressure, increases heart rate and
   occasionally causes paradoxical bradycardia.

 Indications                                                   Contraindications
   • Management of discomfort/pain of cardiac origin and        • Use of erectile dysfunction or pulmonary
     acute pulmonary edema                                        hypertension medications within last 48 hours
   • Protocols: S-126, S-136                                    • Suspected intracranial bleed


 Adult Dose                                                    Pediatric Dose

Classification
  • Antiemetic, selective 5-HT3 antagonist

Mechanism of Action
 • Mechanism of action unclear; believed to function via serotonin antagonism at central and/or peripheral receptors.
   Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3 type are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the
   chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area of the medullary structure that controls vomiting. May cause prolongation of
   the QT interval.

 Indications                                                Contraindications
   • Management of nausea or vomiting                        • Known or suspected long QT syndrome

Classification
  • Alkalizing agent, antidote

Mechanism of Action
 • Increases blood and urinary pH by neutralizing hydrogen ion concentration.

 Indications                                                Contraindications
   • Management of hyperkalemia, tricyclic
     antidepressant overdose, and specific crush injuries
   • Protocols: S-127, S-131, S-134, S-139, S-163,
     S-165, S-169


 Adult Dose                                                 Pediatric Dose
  • NaHCO3 1 mEq/kg IV/IO                                     • NaHCO3 per drug chart IV/IO

Adverse Effects
 • Electrolyte imbalance
 • Pulmonary edema (secondary to sodium overload)
 • Tremors
 • Twitching
 • Seizures (caused by alkalosis)

Notes
 • Monitor the patient closely for signs and symptoms of fluid overload. Because the buffering action produces carbon
   dioxide, ensure the patient has adequate airway and ventilatory support.
 • May precipitate or inactivate other medications; flush the IV line well before and after administering sodium
   bicarbonate. For example, precipitates to form calcium carbonate (chalk) when used with calcium chloride.
   Administer calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate in separate IV/IO or thoroughly flush in between
   administrations using at least 10 mL of normal saline.

       patient to the left 30°


   Transportation and Destination Guidelines
   Pediatric patients who meet criteria outlined in T-460 (Identification of the Pediatric Trauma Center Patient)
   should be transported to the Designated Pediatric Trauma Center, except in the following situations.
   1. Adult with child
      a. If there is a single ambulance (air/ground) with both a pediatric trauma center patient and an adult
          trauma center patient, the ambulance should first transport the more critical patient to the appropriate
          facility. If both patients are critical, or if there are other questions, both may be transported to the
          designated adult trauma center.
      b. Field personnel should consider splitting the team using additional ALS transport vehicles, or
          aeromedical resources to transport the pediatric patient to the pediatric trauma facility and the adult
          patient to the catchment area trauma facility.
   2. Trauma center diversion
          The pediatric patient who is identified as a trauma patient shall be transported to the designated pediatric
          trauma center. When the pediatric trauma center is on diversion, including age-specific diversion, the
          pediatric patient shall be transported to the county-designated backup pediatric trauma center, the
          University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
   3. Pregnant pediatric patient
          A pediatric pregnant trauma patient shall be transported to UCSD.

         • Law enforcement or EMS may remove Taser*
           barbs

     *Taser barb considerations
         • Taser discharge for simple behavioral control is usually benign and does not require transport to BEF
           for evaluation.
         • Patients who are injured; appear to be under the influence of drugs; or present with altered mental
           status or symptoms of illness should have medical evaluation performed by EMS personnel before
           being transported to BEF.
         • If barbs are impaled in anatomically sensitive location such as eye, face, neck, finger/hand, or
           genitalia, do not remove the barb. Transport patient to BEF.
     †
      For severely agitated or combative patients, IN or IM midazolam is the preferred route to decrease risk of
      injury to the patient and personnel.

     Alert: Co-administration of midazolam in patients with alcohol intoxication can cause respiratory
     depression. Consider avoiding or reducing midazolam dose.

  E = Eye deviation
  D = Denial/Neglect

  • Sudden severe headache with no known cause
  • Get specific last known well time in military time (hours: minutes)

Bring witness to ED to verify time of symptom onset and
provide consent for interventions. If witness unable to ride in
ambulance, obtain accurate contact phone number.

Obtain blood glucose. If blood glucose <60 mg/dL, treat for
hypoglycemia.
  • If patient is awake and able to swallow, give 3 oral glucose tabs or
    paste (15 gm total)
  • Patient may eat or drink, if able
  • If patient is unconscious, NPO

Instructions
For each item, select the number that best describes the patient’s sign or symptom. Rate it on just the
apparent relationship to opiate withdrawal. For example, if heart rate is increased because the patient was
jogging prior to assessment, the increased pulse rate would not be added to the score. The scores will be
added together on the final page for a total COWS score.
                Resting Pulse Rate                                Gastrointestinal Upset
      Measured after the patient is sitting or            Over the past 30 minutes

Transportation and Destination Guidelines
Pediatric patients who meet criteria outlined in T-460 (Identification of the Pediatric Trauma Center Patient) should be
transported to the Designated Pediatric Trauma Center, except in the following situations.
1. Adult with child
   a. If there is a single ambulance (air/ground) with both a pediatric trauma center patient and an adult trauma center
       patient, the ambulance should first transport the more critical patient to the appropriate facility. If both patients are
       critical, or if there are other questions, both may be transported to the designated adult trauma center.
   b. Field personnel should consider splitting the team using additional ALS transport vehicles, or aeromedical
       resources to transport the pediatric patient to the pediatric trauma facility and the adult patient to the catchment
       area trauma facility.
2. Trauma center diversion
       The pediatric patient who is identified as a trauma patient shall be transported to the designated pediatric trauma
       center. When the pediatric trauma center is on diversion, including age-specific diversion, the pediatric patient shall
       be transported to the county-designated backup pediatric trauma center, the University of California, San Diego
       (UCSD).
3. Pregnant pediatric patient
       A pediatric pregnant trauma patient shall be transported to UCSD.

    barbs




    *Taser barb considerations
     • Taser discharge for simple behavioral control is usually benign and does not require transport to BEF for
       evaluation.
     • Patients who are injured; appear to be under the influence of drugs; or present with altered mental status or
       symptoms of illness should have medical evaluation performed by EMS personnel before being transported to
       BEF.
     • If barbs are impaled in anatomically sensitive location such as eye, face, neck, finger/hand, or genitalia, do not
       remove the barb. Transport patient to BEF.
    †
     For severely agitated or combative patients, IN or IM midazolam is the preferred route to decrease risk of injury to
     the patient and personnel.

    Alert: Co-administration of midazolam in patients with alcohol intoxication can cause respiratory depression.
    Consider avoiding or reducing midazolam dose.
